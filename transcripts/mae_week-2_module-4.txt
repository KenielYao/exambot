 Hi there and welcome back into today's module, Two Types of Advertising Long and Short. Up until this point in the program, we've been focused on how brands grow over the mid to long term and the budgeting and targeting choices that maximise that growth. Today we're going to get a little more granular and look at the differences in effectiveness when we're advertising to drive short term sales effects versus when we're advertising to create longer term brand and business growth. We're going to explore why both short and long term advertising are important and we're going to look at the kind of advertising that converts the existing demand in the market in the short term and the different kind of advertising that creates future demand over the long term. Much of this module is based on the famous IPA study, The Long and Short of it by Peter Field and Liz Benett and we're going to hear a bit from Liz today and so first up let's hear his take on the difference between short term and long term marketing.

Over the last 10 years or so, I've been working very closely with the IPA doing some fundamental research into how advertising and marketing communications work in hard business term. It's really important to understand that marketing works in two very different ways over the short and the long term. 

The short term effects of marketing are easy to understand. We call this sales activation. Sales activation is any kind of marketing activity which is intended to evoke a fairly immediate response from the consumer. For long term growth you need something different and that's brand building. Brand building is any kind of marketing communications that are intended to produce long term changes in human behavior by creating long term memories. So there are two jobs that marketing needs to do. There's a short term job. This is where we're looking to drive immediate sales as efficiently as possible. We're setting objectives and wanting to see results inside of a six month window, maybe even less than six months. We want to use advertising to capture as big a share as possible of the existing demand in the market. That is the people who are out there and ready to buy now. And so we use what Liz called sales activation. Advertising which is increasingly being described especially in the digital world as performance marketing. 

But that's just one half of our job to drive that short term performance for our brand. The other half of our job is to ensure that the brand and business grow over the long term. For that long term growth to happen efficiently we need to build the brand today in order to improve future sales. We need to set objectives that are longer term. Look further into the future than just six months. We need to use advertising to create future demand. That is make our brand familiar to and liked by people who aren't ready to buy just yet so that when they come into the market they choose us. And so we need to use brand building communications which work very differently to performance marketing comms. And that's something we'll dig into in this module.

Now both of these jobs is equally important for a brand. We need to ensure we're capturing as big a share as possible of this quarter's sales and we need to ensure we're doing the things that will enable us to capture an even bigger share of next year's sales. Both are important but we tend to over focus on the short term and under focus on the long term. We tend to have more pressure from the business to drive short term results as hard as possible. And we have better tools to measure and demonstrate short term results. And so it's easy to forget about the long term. So today we're going to look at the differences between short and long term marketing and advertising and why the long term is much more important than we might think. And we're going to start by looking at the different kinds of results that short term performance campaigns and long term brand campaigns create. 

And I'm going to start with an acknowledgement that if we're just trying to drive immediate sales uplifts then short term performance marketing campaigns are indeed better. They're more likely to drive large immediate sales effects than longer term brand building campaigns. And as much as we all love a big immediate sales uplift we need to bear in mind that there's much more to effectiveness than just creating short term spikes in sales. Real effectiveness is about sustaining sales growth beyond just a single quarter. It's about building market share and becoming a leading brand in our category. It's about reducing price sensitivity and being able to charge more or not discount as much. And it's about doing all of that in a way that's profitable and contributes to greater profitability. And while short term performance campaigns are greater, that one trick of driving short term sales spikes, they're far less effective at literally everything else. If we look at how sales growth is sustained beyond those short spikes, what we see very clearly is that campaigns get more and more effective at driving sales growth the longer they are in market. 

Long term brand building campaigns ultimately create more sales growth than short term campaigns. They also drive much higher profit growth. Short term campaigns don't tend to be particularly profitable. Many drive big top line revenue increases simply by advertising a discount, which ultimately eats into a company's profits. Long term campaigns, on the other hand, are three times as likely to create profitable growth. This is because as we saw with the last chart, the results of these longer term brand building campaigns accumulate over time. They get more effective as they go, lessening the need for discounting and other profit reducing tactics. One of the ways they get more effective as they go is with the results they see from excess share of voice. Campaigns that maintain excess share of voice for three years or more see a much greater market share gain from that excess share of voice investment, which means that longer term campaigns are much more likely to drive large market share increases. Campaigns that run for three years or more are twice as likely to drive very large market share growth. One of the most powerful but most underrated effects of strong brand building is the ability to charge more. As we know from Kantar's research, strong brands are able to achieve higher price premiums, making them more profitable and less susceptible to competitor discounting. This pricing power is an incredibly good indicator of a business's long term prospects. The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, who has become one of the world's richest people by investing in companies over the long term, says, the single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you've got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor, you've got a very good business. If you have to have a prayer session before raising your price, then you've got a terrible business. What we see in the data is that short term performance campaigns literally never improve pricing power. They might convince people to buy, often through the use of discounts and offers, but they never reduce people's sensitivity to the brand's price. Because longer term campaigns are much better at creating pricing power by reducing people's sensitivity to the brand's price and making them accept higher prices. 

Short term and long term campaigns produce different kinds of effects. Short term sales activation or performance marketing campaigns are indeed great at driving immediate spikes in sales, but they're not nearly as good at doing all of the other things we need to be doing with our marketing, creating sustained sales growth, growing market share, reducing price sensitivity, creating profit growth, or making our future marketing more cost efficient by accumulating bigger gains from our excess share of voice. 

This difference in the effects of long and short term campaigns is neatly summed up in this now pretty famous diagram that you may have seen before. The red line is short term sales activation or performance marketing campaigns. Great for producing short term sales spikes, but they're really just treading water for a brand. The blue line is long term brand building campaigns, which accumulate results and end up driving real sustained growth. Here's the chart in Liz's words. Sales activation produces very big short term effects, short term spikes if you like, but they decay away very quickly. The effects of brand building are much more long term. They decay more slowly and they accumulate over time. And as a result, they drive long term growth and profit. In the short term, most of the sales you see are driven by activation. But in the long term, most of the profit you gain comes from brand building. And one of the most important things that chart shows is that you don't get genuine long term growth by piling short term result upon short term result. You really just tread water. As Peter and Liz say, a succession of short term response campaigns will not achieve the same level of business success over the long term as a campaign designed with year on year investment in mind. Whilst this issue has always been important, it has become considerably more so in recent years as the growth of new online channels have focused attention on short term results and metrics. 

Now, at this point, I think we should clarify what we mean by short term sales, activation or performance marketing and long term brand building with some creative examples. When I say sales, activation or performance marketing, I mean creative work that's focused on product information, benefits and reasons to believe. It often has price or offer information, and it usually has some kind of call to action. It's run for short bursts of a few days up to three months. And this type of advertising is designed to get people to buy now. When I say brand building, I mean creative work that's focused on something more than just the product, on the brand's positioning or beliefs, what they stand for or the human truth that's at the heart of their brand. This kind of work isn't created to convey information or persuade people to buy the product. It's designed to stand out, engage people's emotions and give them positive memories of the brand. And it works best when it's run consistently for a long duration of more than six months. 

Of course, all brands need to do both because each of those different kinds of campaigns has a different but completely necessary job to do. And the work I've recently been doing with WARC, we've begun to think about brand building and performance marketing using some new concepts and language. It's based on the idea that there are two types of demand in any market. There's what we call existing demand. Existing demand is people who are in the market and ready to buy now. And the other type of demand we call future demand. This is the people who will at some point in the future buy from the category but who aren't yet in the market and ready to buy just yet. Our research and the research of others suggests that existing demand is a far smaller group than future demand. That at any point in time, only about 5% to 15% of a category's buyers are in the market and ready to buy. The other 85% to 95% are future demand. They will definitely purchase at some point, maybe next week, next month or next year, but not right now. There's always a small pool of existing demand there to be converted. And we should be doing all we can to convert it, to convince as many of those people as possible to choose our brand. Otherwise competitors will win them instead. But that pool of existing demand is small and finite. We can exhaust it. We can convert all of the available demand, then keep running ads that don't work because there isn't any demand left to be converted. The logic is pretty straightforward. Demand conversion advertising cannot convert demand that doesn't exist. So alongside converting the existing demand, we also need to build our brand's future demand. This is about making our brand familiar and meaningful to people who will buy later, priming them to choose or at least consider our brand when they enter the market and are ready to buy. 

Now if this theory is correct, then what we should see is future sales improving from the brand building work we do today. Because we're priming a pool of customers who will come into the category in future, we won't see immediate sales effects from these brand campaigns. We'll see future sales effects. And in fact, this effect has recently been proven out by marketing analytics company Upwave. They did a clever piece of analysis on a bundle of their brand health metrics, which they collectively called customer propensity, which rises and falls over time, according to the health of the brand. And then they ran a series of comparisons against those brands share of sales over time. And what they saw was that increases in brand health led to near identical increases in share of sales around five months later. You can see that in the chart here. The dotted line is the brand health metric rising and falling. And the solid line shows sales five months later, rising and falling in just the same way. That's the brand creating future demand one month, and that future demand coming into the market and buying from the brand five months later. 

But how do we know that those people wouldn't have come into the market anyway? Did they really end up there because of that future demand activity five months earlier? Well, there's another interesting piece of research that shines some light on this. It's from WARC and an e-commerce marketing technology company called Perpetua. In their data, they can see how performance marketing and brand marketing influence different groups of people across different timeframes. They looked across masses of online purchase data in Amazon Marketing Cloud and found that exposure to brand advertising made people who hadn't bought from a brand before significantly more likely to do so, about 25% more likely. This shows us that if we want to bring new people into our brand and future, it helps to expose them to brand activity. The same study also showed that while performance marketing does indeed work immediately on people who aren't already in the market, brand activity catches people who aren't ready to buy our category just yet and makes them more likely to buy our brand when they are ready. Their data shows that online performance marketing produces about 70% of its results within two hours of being viewed and that conversely, online brand activity produces 70% of its results three to 14 days after being viewed. It's creating future demand rather than converting existing demand. Over at the Econometrics company Magic Numbers, they found the same thing in their own data, that media which is more performance-centric like search and social produces no sales effects at all past the first couple of weeks from when it ran. But the more brand-centric media like TV and outdoor have much longer-lasting effects, often causing sales up to two years after those ads ran. Again this shows how future demand activity has the effect of planting positive memories that are activated when consumers come into the category later, but that existing demand activity has no such effect. 

But of course, let's come back to the point that it's important to both convert the existing demand in the market, which performance marketing is great at, and also make sure that we're talking to that much larger group of future customers so that they don't choose another brand when they do come into the category. And the more future demand we build for our brand today, the more existing demand we'll have to convert tomorrow, because today's future demand is tomorrow's existing demand. Let's say that this quarter 5% of the category was in the market and ready to buy our brand and we scoop those up effectively. And we also did some great brand building and made our brand familiar and meaningful to 10% of people who weren't in the market this quarter, but who will be in future. When we get to that future, we'll have a larger pool of existing demand to convert, meaning we can more efficiently drive more sales in that future. Basically we've made life much easier for our future selves by investing in brand building activity that's created future demand that we'll be able to efficiently scoop up later. So let's say we spent this quarter really going to town on performance marketing. We rung every sale that we could get out of that 5% existing demand and we did barely any brand building activity. We only made our brand familiar and meaningful to 2% of people who weren't in the market this quarter, but who will be in future. When we get to that future, we'll have a smaller pool of existing demand to convert, meaning that it'll be more difficult to drive high sales in that future. We've made life really hard for our future selves by leaving us with fewer future customers to convert. 

So we need to be doing both, harvesting our existing demand with short-term performance marketing and creating future demand with longer-term brand building. But how much should we be spending on each? What's the right split? If we think about the advertising we're exposed to every day, we'd probably conclude the normal split is about 90% shouty ads for brands trying to get us to buy their product immediately and 10% brand ads that are trying to build a positive bond with us. Certainly if we look at the way marketing has been going, it's been trending shorter and shorter term. The amount of short-term campaigns entered into the IPA's effectiveness data bank has increased significantly across the past two decades. And recent data from WALK shows that marketers are increasing investment into performance marketing and cutting investment in brand. So perhaps what's normal is a 90-10 split between performance and brand, but is that actually what's most effective? In actual fact, what Peter and Les and the IPA found is that for optimal long-term effectiveness, we should be spending somewhere between 30% and 50% on performance and the remainder on brand. They figured this out by looking at the overall excess share of voice efficiency of different brands and compared that to the percentage those brands spent on performance. The brands that spent between 30% and 50% on performance achieved much larger market share gains than those that spent outside of that range. This tells us that if we spend less than 30% of our budget on performance, we're not spending enough to capture all the future demand we're creating. We're missing out on sales. And if we spend more than 50%, we're not putting enough of our budget towards brand building, so we're not creating enough future demand to convert efficiently later on. This is how they got to what they call the 60-40 rule, that for maximum effectiveness, we should be spending about 40% of our budget on sales activation or performance marketing and 60% on brand building. 

And there's reason to believe that as the digital environment continues to develop, we should be spending even less on performance and even more on brand. Here's Les to explain. So you need short-term sales activation and long-term brand building, and you need them working together, and you need them to be balanced. Our research suggests that the optimum effectiveness tends to be achieved when about 60% of the budget is devoted to long-term brand building and about 40% to short-term activation. We call this the 60-40 rule. But our latest research shows that that rule, that balance, changes depending on category and context. What we're finding in the data is as the digital economy evolves, sales activation is becoming much more efficient. What that means is that activation as it becomes more efficient requires less budget. And so almost counterintuitively, the optimum split is shifting away from sales activation towards brand building. To put it simply, in a digital world, emotional brand building is more important than it's ever been. As Les said, the optimal balance changes depending on the category and context. And he and Peter actually did a bunch of analysis across lots of different categories and contexts to see how that balance changed. The work is pretty deep and complicated, but a really easy way to figure out the best balance for your category and context is to use the calculator that brand tracking company Tracksuit have created. You can put in all your variables and it'll spit out your ideal balance. It doesn't cover every type of category or context in detail, but it's a great starting point and really fun to use. And I'm guessing you might find it's quite a different balance from the way your brand spends at the moment. 

Most brands are weighted more toward performance marketing or sales activation and away from brand building. And everyone who works in effectiveness bemoans the seemingly ever-increasing short-termism in marketing and dreams of those healthy in days back in the 1980s when brands were much more long-term and brand-focused. So I think it's consoling to learn that actually it wasn't that different back then either. In 1992, JWT's US Head of Strategy, Peter Kim, got access to a Harvard Business School database called PIMS, or the Profit Impact of Market Strategy database. The database spanned two decades and held marketing and financial records for thousands of businesses across a broad range of categories. And he did a bunch of analysis that was pretty similar to what Peter and Les did in the long and short of it. One of the things he found was that between 1969 and 1989, on average, brands went from spending about 47% of their budgets on brand building to spending just 35%, with the other 65% going on sales activation. Back in those days, brand building was simply referred to as advertising, and promotion meant all the stuff a company did to try to drive short-term sales. As you can see here, marketers were trending hard away from brand building through those two decades. Then he looked at the differences in companies that balance toward brand and companies that balance toward activation in terms of their return on marketing investment and market share. And he found that the companies that balance toward brand were much more successful. He wrote, brands having high advertising to promotion ratios are more likely to be market dominators, that is, to rank first in a category and have sales volume one and a half times greater than the nearest competitor. In addition, the larger the ratio of advertising to promotion, the greater the ROI. When the percentage spent on advertising is relatively low, e.g. 24%, so is ROI, about 18%. When the advertising portion rises above 50%, ROI is substantially greater, about 31%. In short, heavily advertised brands are more likely than heavily promoted brands to be category leaders, as well as to be highly profitable. So this mirrors very closely Les and Peter's work showing that we need to have a balance of brand and activation, but to build the biggest and most effective brands and companies, that balance should be weighted toward brand and away from activation. It was true then, and it's still true now.

Now you might remember something else Les said in that last video, that emotional brand building is more important than it's ever been. And the operative word there was emotional. Now we're going to talk a lot more in a later module about why emotional advertising is so much more powerful than rational advertising when it comes to building brands. But for now we'll focus on what Peter and Les found in the long and short data. They compared rational campaigns, those campaigns that primarily try to persuade people by communicating information, with emotional campaigns, those campaigns that are primarily concerned with engaging people in a story that's humorous or tugs on the heartstrings or inspires us. When they compared the effectiveness of emotional and rational campaigns across the range of important effectiveness metrics, emotional campaigns outperformed rational campaigns across just about every one of them. Whether it's sales growth, market share growth, pricing power, loyalty effects, awareness, trust, differentiation, or fame, emotional campaigns are more likely to create very large positive effects. But when it comes to driving immediate sales, those short term sales spikes that performance marketing is so good for, rational campaigns actually outperform emotional campaigns. The reason for this is pretty simple and it goes back to the ideas of existing demand and future demand. If you're in the market and ready to buy right now, what's most useful to you is facts. Facts about the product, what's better about it, where you can get it from, how much it costs. When you're looking to buy something, you need that information. You want it. You spend time willingly consuming it. But if you're not in the market and not ready to buy right now, facts aren't useful to you at all. If you're not interested in changing your internet provider right now, information about relative megabits per second speeds and early termination fees just will not go into your brain. You'll filter those informational ads out without even being conscious of the fact you're doing so. But you will stop to watch an ad that catches your attention and makes you feel something. 

Not many of us were in the market for buying a truck at the time, but most of us watched Jean-Claude Van Damme doing his epic split on a pair of Volvo trucks. That kind of advertising doesn't tell us much about the product, but it stands out and leaves an imprint, a positive memory in our minds. And later, even when we do come into the category, that positive memory makes us more likely to choose that brand. That's probably one of the reasons Volvo's truck business has done so well over the past decade, reaching its highest ever market share in a record sales year in 2022. Everyone remembers that ad. 

So there are two types of advertising that work best for those two different jobs of converting existing demand in the short term and building future demand for the long term. To convert existing demand, we want to be more rational and informational. We want to call to action, to drive an immediate response. And of course, we also want to target those who are most likely to be in the market to buy right now. And so the targeting should be quite tight. To create future demand, we want to be more emotional, to elicit positive emotions using work that's humorous or inspirational or that pulls on the heartstrings. We don't need calls to action as we're not trying to drive an immediate response. We're trying to create positive memories about the brand, which would actually be undermined by offers and calls to action. And we want to target very broadly. We want to reach all category buyers to create the most future demand we can. Here's Liz to sum that up. 

Great marketing campaigns need both short term sales activation and long term brand building, and they need them to work together. Those two different kinds of marketing strategies, those two different strands require different ingredients. Short term sales activation requires tight targeting. You need to talk to the people who are most likely to buy and respond right now, often in quite rational communications in order to close the deal. Ideally, what you want is to facilitate a response by perhaps including a direct response mechanism. Brand building needs much broader reach because you need to talk to people not just who are in the market right now, but people who might come to market over the next two to three years. You need to engage them with things that are more humanly relevant, more general, more universal and crucially, you need to engage them at the emotional level. The final ingredient is memorability. Remember the point of brand building is to create long term memories that influence sales over the long term. So everything you do needs to be memorable. 

Now something that's really critical in managing advertising over the short and long terms is how we measure and evaluate it. If we measure long term work against short term metrics or vice versa, we're likely to incorrectly conclude that the advertising hasn't worked. When we're doing short term work to drive immediate sales spikes, we want to be measuring that either in real time as the campaign's running, so we can tweak and adjust as we go or directly after the campaign has run. Those sorts of campaigns don't have any ongoing effects and so all the results they produce will be visible as soon as the campaign's finished. And we want to be primarily looking at immediate sales effects. Did sales go up? And potentially we might like to look at efficiency measures like what our cost of acquisition was or our short term return on investment. When we're doing long term work to drive brand growth and business growth, we want to be measuring that over the longer term. We'll only see a small amount of the results in the first three months. As we saw earlier, long term effects compound. They start small and then they get bigger as we go. So we want to monitor those results over the long term, over a period that's more like six months to three years. And we want to use brand health metrics like brand awareness or consideration to make sure we're building the brand and longer term commercial metrics like sales growth and market share over time to see how we're growing the business. Because these two types of advertising work in different ways, it's important we measure them in different ways, too. 

I want to finish on a great example of a brand doing both of these kinds of creative but within the same overall campaign. This is a mega effective campaign for Expedia that won at the IPA Effectiveness Awards, the Creative Effectiveness Lines and the European Effies. I'm going to start by showing the TV ads that did the long term brand building. Have a look. 

Oh, dear. That's not good, is it Rupert and Tatiana? Your invitations to go skeet shooting on your new yacht have been politely ignored because you're being upstaged by a couple who own matching paddle skis, for goodness sake. Yes, all eyes are on David and Laura, who've just come back from the Himalayas. Did you know people there say hello by sticking out their tongues? Nobody here did. Discover thousands of destinations with Expedia, at all protected. Oh, that looks like an animated chat, doesn't it, Philip? Dear, oh, dear, the skinny macchiatos just the way your boss likes them appear to have lost their currency. Craig here has just been to Bulgaria. Did you know that in Bulgaria a nod means no and a head shape means yes? Your boss didn't. It seems there's a new golden boy on this floor. Discover thousands of destinations with Expedia, at all protected. Bravo, Hugo. That's an amazing new trick. But what sorcery is this? It's Brian, the sound guy, just back from a holiday in Hawaii. He saved by booking his flight and hotel together on Expedia's website. Hawaii. Tough to beat Hawaii, Hugo. Very tough. Saved by booking your flight and hotel together with Expedia, at all protected. 

These had print and outdoor executions that communicated some of those interesting facts about far-flung travel locations. They're not hard sell. There's no buy now on them. They're there to engage people and give them positive feelings and memories about the brand. But alongside this work, they also ran a stream of ads that were all about harvesting existing demand and driving immediate sales, with offers and sales and calls to action. These had the same look and feel as the brand advertising, which is a way of reminding people of those great brand ads they enjoyed while hitting them with today's deal. What's important here is that Expedia didn't try to do both jobs with the same ads. They had brand ads targeting a broad audience, seeking only to create a bond with that audience. Then they had performance ads targeting people in the market, seeking only to give people the information and offers they needed to buy. And what happened? Brand awareness and reputation and consideration all shot up. The customer base grew by 14%. Repeat users grew. Booking value grew at twice the rate of the category. And Expedia got $11 in profit for every $1 spent on the campaign. A massive 11 times ROI. It's a really terrific example of a brand managing both long-term brand building and short-term performance in the most effective way. 

So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, that advertising works differently in the short term to how it works in the long term. In the short term, we're looking to activate sales by capturing as much existing demand as possible, getting all of those buyers who are ready to buy to choose us. We need to do this with rational communications about the product or service targeted tightly at people who are most likely to buy and by including an offer or call to action to close the sale. And we should measure this activity in real time or in the short term using performance and sales metrics. In the long term, we're looking to build our brand by creating as much future demand as possible by building a connection with those people who aren't ready to buy just yet so that when they do come into the market, they gravitate toward us. We need to do this with emotional communications about the brand, targeted very broadly at all category buyers and making those communications as memorable as possible. And we should measure this over the longer term using brand health tracking and by monitoring longer term sales, market share, profitability and ROI. And we learned that the optimal mix of these two types of advertising is 40% performance and 60% brand building. So that's it for today's module. Remember to read through the workbook on today's session. If you've got time, have a look at the extra content. Any questions about the content, leave those in the comments section of this page and we'll endeavor to answer those either here or in the next live session. And I look forward to seeing you again for module five.
