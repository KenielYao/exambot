 Hi there, welcome back into today's module, creativity and effectiveness. In this module, we're going to look at the role creativity plays in advertising effectiveness. And this has been a subject close to my own heart for my whole career. I grew up in the advertising industry in the early 2000s when there was a lot of skepticism about advertising creativity, especially from the client community. They saw ad agencies seemingly obsessed with creative awards and worried that their focus was more on winning awards for themselves than on building the client's brand and growing their business. And there was very little evidence out there about creativity. There had always been brilliant creative people who'd made the case for creativity with inspiring words and stories and examples of great creative work. But if you wanted hard evidence beyond the rhetoric, it was difficult to come by. And so around 2009, I began to research creativity and effectiveness. I did a couple of data driven studies myself, but mostly I collected up the work of other researchers around the world who had looked at creativity through a scientific lens in universities and institutions like the IPA. And in 2011, I published it in a book called The Case for Creativity. And in this module, we're going to look at some of the main findings of the book and explore what we mean by creativity, the evidence around how creativity contributes to effectiveness and how creativity works to make advertising more effective. I'm going to start with a quote from Keith Weed, who wrote the forward to the second edition of The Case for Creativity. Keith was the chief marketing officer of Unilever for most of the 2010s and so was responsible for the return on investment of billions of dollars of ad spend every year. He says, leading brands and agencies have known for many years that more creative work delivers better results than safe and rational advertising. What has been exciting in more recent times is to see the emerging proof of this, the hard evidence that creative work is more memorable, more effective and more able to drive overall business performance. And that's what we're going to look at today, the hard evidence that yes, highly creative advertising is more commercially effective than less creative or uncreative advertising. But before we get to that, I want to spend some time talking about what I mean when I say that a campaign is highly creative. Of course, what I think is creative might be different to how you think about creativity. It's certainly relatively subjective. And so the way we make it a little more objective is to define creativity according to what the judges of creative awards look for when they're deciding whether or not to give a campaign an award. Now again, you may ask what the value of awards is and whether we should care about how award judges judge creativity. But in fact, that's what the debate has always been about. Does work with creative award winning qualities just serve the interests of creative people advancing their careers? Or is it in the interests of clients that agencies produce work with those award winning qualities for their brands? And the data we look at most of the time will be comparing creativity awarded work with non awarded work. And so let's first look at what creative award judges look for. What are the defining qualities of creative award winning work? And there are three key creative award winning qualities. The first is originality. This is the fundamental hurdle in creative award judging. Has this or something very similar to this been done before? At its essence, creativity is about doing something new, something unique. So judges look for novel and innovative ideas that haven't been seen before. Jim McDowell, who was the marketer behind so much of the most creatively awarded BMW and Mini Work says, to me, more creative marketing takes a really big step. It's not a small incremental add on to something you've seen before. It takes a really big step in a direction that I'd never even imagined. And here's an example of the difference between a conventional and unoriginal ad and a highly original one. The Volvo ad on the left is conventional. It's a nice shot of the product with a headline communicating a product benefit and some copy going into more detail. It's a normal automotive ad. We've all seen ads like this a thousand times. The TV equivalent is the vehicle cruising along highways and winding roads with a voice over telling you all about the car and upbeat music playing in the background. Ads like that are commonplace. They're not original. They're not new novel, innovative ways of communicating something about the brand or product. The campaign on the right, on the other hand. I've had my ups and downs, my fair share of bumpy roads and heavy winds. That's what made me what I am today. Now I stand here before you. What you see is a body crafted to perfection. A pair of legs engineered to defy the laws of physics. A mindset to master the most epic of splits. Jean-Claude Van Damme doing the splits in between two trucks reversing down a highway with an in your track in the background is a completely original way to show off the precision of Volvo's steering system. When it came out, we'd never seen an ad like that, which is one of the reasons it spread like it did and we all ended up seeing it. And one of the reasons it won so many top creative awards. And it wasn't just highly original. It was also hugely effective. It drove Volvo's truck sales up by 23% and won the Cannes Creative Effectiveness Lines Grand Prix in 2015. So that's the first of our three creative award-winning qualities, originality. The second quality of highly creative campaigns is that they're really engaging. They make us want to get involved or watch the ad again or interact with the campaign in some way. Or they grab our emotions and make us laugh or cry or think or wonder. Jim Stengel, who was PNG's CMO for a really long time and who really led the revolution in terms of creativity at PNG in the 2000s, says, I think if people say that it touches them and it makes them care and they want to see it again, I think those are two very powerful ideas. And in fact, one of the things PNG started doing during that time was testing whether consumers wanted to see an ad again as one of the main metrics of whether their ads were any good. Consumers don't often care to see advertising again, but creativity makes ads more engaging, meaning consumers are more drawn to them and more likely to engage with them and remember them. Here's an example of the difference between a conventional, not particularly engaging ad and a highly engaging one. The Burger King Whopper ad on the left is a good old-fashioned burger ad. Nice big shot of a burger looking delicious, a headline that reminds us that Burger King's burgers are flame grilled. It's not actually a bad poster. It's nicely art directed. The headline's interesting. It's just a burger ad. Do you feel it engaging your emotions? Would you share it on your social feed? Would you find yourself wanting to look at it again? Probably not. The campaign on the right, however. What story you guys have been waiting for? I don't know if you've heard of this. This is the New York Times today. There was an ad that was taken out by Burger King. To McDonald's, when Burger King asks McDonald's to join forces to create the ultimate burger, The McWopper. McWhopper. McWhoopin. McWopper. McWhopper. McWopper. These would benefit the non-profit called Peace One Day. The letter concludes, we've put together McWopper.com which details the proposal. Corporate activation on this scale creates mass awareness. We've designed a proposed pop-up restaurant, the packaging even the staff uniforms. Social media is dining out on McWhopper. It's everywhere. And you gotta love this. Burger King has extended the olive branch in McD's own backyard. Sadly, McDonald's CEO nixed the idea. We love the intention, but think our two brands could do something bigger to make a difference. P.S. a simple phone call we'll do next time. What an a- I'll do this. I'll do this. I'll do this. I'll do this. I'll do this. To make the McWopper a reality, you'll just have to take matters into your own hands. To date, thousands of do-it-yourself McWoppers have been created and shared on social media. I'm only thinking of well-pasted the mind. Why is this a real thing? Oh, the muck, oh man. This is the first time I've ever eaten a burger for world peace. I mostly just eat a macaroni. Throwing up someone else's burger on someone else's bun. When me, it's close. When me, it's close. Inviting your main competitor to join forces on a burger to create one burger out of the two most iconic burgers on the planet, that's a really engaging idea. It's funny. It's audacious. It creates a huge tension immediately. What will McDonald's answer be? It earned over $200 million in free media because the press was so engaged with it. It had people all over the world heading into their local BK and McDonald's to buy both burgers and make their own McWopper. It sold an incredible amount of whoppers, $69 million worth, a 17% sales uplift, which is why it won the Grand Effie in the US in 2017. That's the second of our three creative award-winning qualities, engagement. The third and final quality of highly creative campaigns is that they're well executed. By that, I mean that they have a high degree of executional craft quality. Things like design and photography and typography and illustration have been invested in and cared about. People often say execution is everything. What they mean when they say this is that an idea executed poorly can be completely unsuccessful while the same idea executed brilliantly can be wildly successful. This is something that's really important to bear in mind. We live in an age when anyone can do basic photography and video on their phone, and there are a million cheap designers out there. But cutting corners on execution is like showing up to a date in cheap old clothes. You're still the same person, but the impression you create is a completely different one. Here are some examples of what I mean. There's two ads for products that treat facial blemishes. On the left, a product that treats cold sores, and on the right, a product that treats pimples. In both ads, a woman covers up her blemish with her finger in a pose that suggests she's thinking as opposed to covering something up. Both imply that the product is a better way to treat facial blemishes than simply putting your finger over them. It's interesting to think about how these two pretty much identical ads make you feel. Which one draws you in more? Which one makes you think more? Which one would you like to see again? On the left, the ad looks like it's being shot on a phone or a cheap camera with no special lighting, an average person as opposed to a professional model or actor, and a plain white background. On the right, the ad's been shot professionally with proper lighting and wardrobe and makeup, and an actress or model who knows what she's doing. Her facial expression is perfect. She looks clever, which ties in with the headline. She also looks smart and successful. She has an aspirational quality that helps position the product as being higher quality. Here's a product that clever, smart, successful people use. The shot creates a mood. It has a sophisticated humor about it. It draws you in more and makes you feel more. Here's another example from the first wave of COVID lockdowns. Both communicate the same idea that if you're missing your favorite fast food, you can create it at home from regular supermarket ingredients. On the left, Iceland's supermarket showing how you can recreate KFC with the chicken, chips, corn, gravy, and soft drink products that they sell. On the right, Burger King's showing how you can recreate the Whopper at home from equally commonplace ingredients. There's a good chance you've seen the Burger King ad before. When it was made, it spread across the internet, reaching most corners of the world. And there's an equally good chance you never saw the Iceland ad. It was hardly noticed. What was the difference? Execution or craft? Look at the Iceland ad. Sheddy packed shots plunk down in no particular order on a plain background with clip art shadowing and more copy than is required to get the idea across. By contrast, the Burger King ad has been cared about from a craft perspective. It was still locked down and they couldn't shoot real photography, but they've chosen existing pack and ingredient shots that feel well crafted themselves. They're well lit and shot. They look appetizing. Where there is shadowing, it's thoughtful. The background is interesting. And the order that the ingredients appear is in the order that they're actually stacked in a Whopper burger. The layout is pleasing to the eye. And the copy is to the point, the quarantine Whopper. People are clever enough to figure the rest out for themselves and in fact take pleasure in solving that puzzle. The idea is the same, but the dedication to executional craft meant that the Burger King ad was vastly more effective at generating exposure for the brand. Lastly, let's look at a winner of the Cannes Film Craft Lines Grand Prix. This category at Lyons is all about brilliant, executional craft and in 2015, John Lewis won the top award for their Christmas ad, Monty the Penguin. We've all seen ads with animals in them. Some of them executed underwhelmingly and others like this executed brilliantly. Take a look. It's a beautiful story and much of the emotional impact comes from the moment we switch from those gorgeous realistic penguins to the boys' scruffy penguin toys. That his imagination was brought to life in such a perfectly executed way is what creates our emotional bond with him. And that's why it won the Film Craft Grand Prix award. The ad was extraordinarily commercially successful, returning eight pounds in profit for every one pound invested. The year ended so well that John Lewis staff were given a bonus worth more than 10% of their salary. The campaign won the Creative Effectiveness Lines Grand Prix in 2016. And if you're still unsure about the difference good execution makes, I love the analysis that Orlando Wood at System One did on one ad that was graded four different ways. Grading is the process of adjusting the color tones in a film. It's a bit like a really sophisticated version of Instagram filters. It's fairly subtle and it's unlikely a regular consumer would consciously notice the difference between one grade and another. But subconsciously, it makes a really big difference. System One ran the same ad with four slightly different grades through their testing process. And each scored differently. The worst grade scored 2.7 stars out of five on long-term business effect potential. And the best grade scored 3.9. According to System One, that's a really big difference in the effectiveness of the ad. And that's just the grading of the film. Imagine the differences in effectiveness of all the other executional creative choices we make when we're producing a campaign. And that's the value of great executional people. Great creatives, directors, illustrators, photographers. They have really good taste and they make all of those executional choices better than cheaper, less talented executional people or people who are inexperienced at making those choices. So that's how we define creativity. By three qualities that creative award judges look for when deciding whether a campaign should be given a creative award. Highly creative campaigns are all three of these things. They're original, they're engaging, and they're well executed. So now that we have a definition of creativity, let's find out whether campaigns with these creative award-winning qualities are any more effective than campaigns without them. Where we're going to start is by going back to the chart we looked at in the investing for growth module. Peter and Liz's chart that shows that on average, effective advertising creates half a point of market share growth for every 10 points of excess share of voice. That's our baseline of all the case studies in the IPA data bank. A couple of years after making that chart, Peter had the idea to separate out the creative award winners from the campaigns that hadn't won creative awards and see whether there was a difference in effectiveness. And what he found was quite extraordinary. He found that the creatively award winning cases were seven times as effective as the non-awarded campaigns. Where the average campaign generated half a point of market share gain per 10 points of excess share of voice, the highly creative campaigns generated three and a half points of market share gain. This was a landmark finding because it really proved wrong all of the people who thought that creatively awarded work was less effective. That creativity was just a folly of creative agencies who wanted to win awards. Not only were creatively awarded campaigns as effective, they were vastly more effective. In fact, Peter and Liz have looked at all kinds of different things that boost the effect of excess share of voice, from targeting to media mix to campaign duration, and none of them are as impactful as creativity. What this tells us is that we should be focusing first on making sure we've got amazing creative work. And then it only then get on to all the other factors. And in fact, this has been proven out again and again in different ways by researchers around the world. Most famously, market research company Kantar partnered with econometrics guru Paul Dyson to look at different advertising variables and their impact on campaign profitability. First they asked marketers to rank those variables according to what they thought was the most important to campaigns delivering a profitable return. The marketers said getting the media mix right was the most important, then getting the brand and performance mix right, then getting the targeting right, then in fourth place making sure the creative work was good. In fact, what the econometric analysis showed was that the number one factor was the size of the brand. It's not fair, but if your brand is already big, your ads automatically work better. Now that's a tough variable because at any given time we're stuck with the size that our brand is, we can't adjust that variable. Becoming in at number two was creative quality. Its ability to impact campaign effectiveness was more than twice the next best variable. And creative quality was massively more important than targeting and media mix. Nielsen did a similar study in 2017 that found the same thing that the creative quality was the biggest driver of sales effectiveness and much more so than other media variables. And in 2019, Mark Ritson led an analysis with the Effie Awards of almost 6,000 Effie entries from between 1990 and 2018. And he too made a list of what the most important ingredients were to effectiveness. Like Kantar and Dyson, he found that brand size was the most important variable. And he also found that the next most important was, you guessed it, creativity. Again ahead of all the media stuff. In my time researching this subject, I've never seen a study that concludes that less creative work is more effective. Or that creative quality isn't the number one most important thing to focus on if we want the most effective advertising. It's been studied and modeled now so many different ways and the conclusion is always the same. Creativity matters and it matters more than anything else. Now I want to go back to Peter's study. He found that creatively awarded campaigns were much more effective. And he also went on to show that as those campaigns became more creative, that is they received more awards or better awards like Gold's and Grand Prix, they also became more effective, driving even more market share gain from the same level of spend. This tells us something very important. That actually, creative award judges are looking for the kinds of qualities that result in greater effectiveness. And by the way, creative award judges almost never have any sort of effectiveness information for the campaigns they're judging. Their job isn't to think about or assess the effectiveness of the campaigns. It's just to assess how creative they were. But as the data shows very clearly, those creative qualities are the same ones that lead to greater effectiveness. And again, when I say effectiveness, I mean commercial effectiveness. When we look at creatively awarded campaigns versus non-awarded campaigns, across the range of commercial effectiveness measures, sales, market share, pricing power, loyalty and penetration, creatively awarded campaigns are more likely to generate very large effects across all of those measures. The crazy thing is that even though creative work was proven to be so much more effective over a decade ago, we continue to spend most of our budgets on uncreative work. Creatively awarded work tends to receive less than half the media spend of ordinary uncreative and less effective work. One of the reasons for this is that we think of creativity as being risky. And so we like to be creative out around the edges rather than with the campaigns that are more central to our brands. This is, of course, a spurious belief. The data shows very clearly that it's much riskier to do ordinary uncreative advertising. Those campaigns are much more likely to generate a poorer return across every important effectiveness metric. But still we continue to reduce our spend on creativity. This chart shows that over the past two decades, our industry has reduced its spend on all campaigns. But the reduction in spend on creatively awarded campaigns has been much more severe. It's as if upon hearing that creativity works harder, our response as an industry has been to try to use creativity to make up for an adequate budget. But this is a false logic. Creativity multiplies the effects of adequate spend. It's not a substitute for spend. The outtake here is that we should be using creativity on our biggest campaigns with the most spend behind them. That's how we'll enjoy the greatest returns that creativity can bring. The other thing we've done with creativity over the past decade has shifted to trying to use it on very short term campaigns. The percentage of creatively awarded campaigns in the IPA Data Bank that were run for very short terms rose from zero in 2008 to nearly 40% in 2018. But what we know is that creativity is much more effective when deployed over the long term. Across a range of important effectiveness metrics, creatively awarded campaigns that ran for more than six months were more effective than those that ran for less than six months. And the one thing that we know creativity isn't as effective for is driving immediate sales spikes. Remember in the long and short module, we talked about short term sales activation or performance marketing needing to be quite rational and offer driven, whereas long term results are created by more emotional work. Well, it's the same with creativity. If we just need to drive short term sales, it's better to get out with a pretty rational and uncreative campaign and targeted at people who are in the market and ready to buy. But if we want to drive all those other long term metrics like sustained sales growth, market share growth, pricing power, profitability, a more creative approach applied over a term of more than six months is far more likely to work. Here's Peter talking about how the shift to using creativity on smaller, lower budget short term campaigns is damaging effectiveness. There's been an enormously damaging four or five years in terms of the effectiveness of campaigns and particularly of creatively awarded campaigns. And that we can pretty positively identify the causes of that. And that the most important cause of that is short termism. That is the growing tendency for marketing and advertising budgets to be spent behind short term sales initiatives, by which I mean less than six months. And then that, because of the way creativity works, has a particularly damaging effect on the chances of creativity driving sales success. But the other factor that has been undermining creative effectiveness has been a budgetary issue, which is that all budgets have suffered as a result of the global financial crisis. And to a degree, we have to live with that. There is a new mood business. But the problem for creative awarded, creatively awarded campaigns is that because they always had lower budgets, so this trend has actually taken them into really dangerous territory where their budgets are below maintenance levels. And at a level at which it is completely irrational to expect growth. And so clearly, clients are expecting creativity to be a substitute for budget as opposed to a multiplier of it. And the data simply doesn't support that. It's a false logic. Creativity works by multiplying positive investments in growth. It cannot make up for a shortfall. That's just not the way creativity works. You have to give it fuel to enjoy its maximum benefit. So the outtake here is pretty clear. Rational, uncreative work when we're only looking to drive a quick short term sales spike. Emotional work with creative award winning qualities when we're wanting to do that bigger job of sustainably building the brand and business over the long term. Now unsurprisingly, the effectiveness of creativity also means that the advertising agencies that produce the most creative work also produce the most effective work for their clients. This has been another old skepticism from marketers who wonder whether all of those creative awards piled up in the reception areas of the prestige agencies really mean anything about how good a job they'll do. So using a very large set of creative award and FE award data spanning hundreds of agencies from the US and Europe, I looked at the correlation between creative awards and effectiveness awards. What I found was that as agencies become more creatively awarded, they also become more effectiveness awarded. If an agency is winning lots of creative awards, they're about six times as likely to produce campaigns that are effective enough to go on to win FE awards, which are predominantly judged on commercial results. So yes, it turns out that lots of creative awards in your agency's reception is a pretty good indicator that they're capable of producing effective work. But why does creativity work? How does creativity make campaigns more effective? Well, to help answer that question, I'm going to use some of the wise words of Bill Birnback, who was one of the founders of DDB and a famously effective creative leader from the 1950s and 60s. Birnback said all sorts of pithy and memorable things about how advertising works. And to this day, you can find a book of all his quotes in most DDB offices. Birnback had an uncanny sense of how creativity makes advertising more effective. But he was practicing at a time way before any of us had studied creativity and effectiveness. He had no data to go on, just his instincts. But those instincts turned out to be remarkably accurate and have since been proven out by researchers all around the world. So let's look at how creativity works through the words of Bill Birnback. One of his most famous aphorisms is, if your advertising goes unnoticed, everything else is academic. He meant that if no one notices your ad, it doesn't matter how compelling the message is, how good the strategy was, how efficient the media buy was. If people just tune it out, it won't have any effect whatsoever. Creativity's first effect is that it makes campaigns stand out and get noticed among the clutter, as proven by researchers published in Management Science in 2002. Dull ordinary campaigns are far less likely to be noticed. And when we're exposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of commercial messages each day, it's a massive fight to cut through. And the competition isn't just other brands in our category, it's every brand advertising, every other ad out there, every day. Birnback also said that the difference between the forgettable and the enduring is artistry. He meant that more artistic, more creative work is more likely to be remembered and less likely to be forgotten. Creativity's second effect is that it makes campaigns more likely to be remembered and recalled by consumers, as proven by researchers published in the Journal of Advertising in 2005. Remember in the long and short module we talked about brand building being about creating positive memories about a brand? Creativity makes campaigns more likely to create these positive memories. Something else Birnback said way before it was fashionable was that word of mouth is the best medium of all. And creativity's third effect is that it makes campaigns more likely to be talked about, written about and shared. Why is that important? Well, what Peter and Les have shown is that campaigns that create what they call fame are the most effective of all. By fame they mean that the campaign generated a lot of word of mouth or earned media and impressions. Across all key effectiveness metrics, fame campaigns outperform others. Fame campaigns are the most efficient. They generate larger market share growth at the same level of spend. This makes sense because all of that free publicity means that the media budget ends up going much further and reaching many more people. And this means the campaigns that create fame are the most profitable. Rational campaigns are the least profitable. Rational campaigns are much more profitable. But fame campaigns are the most profitable of all. And what creates fame? You guessed it, creativity. Fame is twice as likely to come from campaigns with creative award-winning qualities than from work without those qualities. Birnback also said that getting a product known isn't the answer. Getting it wanted is the answer. Some of the best known product names have failed. Creativity's fourth effect is that it makes campaigns more likely to persuade and convince consumers. Creativity is more persuasive. It's more convincing. People are more likely to let their guard down and believe messages that are presented in original and engaging ways. And that was proven by researchers published in Marketing Science in 2009. Lastly, Birnback said that properly practiced creativity can make one ad do the work of 10. Right on this count too. As we saw earlier, creatively awarded work mightn't quite be 10 times as effective, but it is seven times, and that's still a remarkable difference. Creativity's fifth effect is that it makes campaigns much more efficient and effective at driving commercial outcomes. Now what I want to finish on today is one of my favorite pieces of academic research into creativity and effectiveness. This work was done at the Stockholm School of Economics in 2008, where researchers wondered whether consumers thought any differently about companies that advertised more or less creatively. They designed an experiment where they divided 1,200 people into two groups. The first group was shown an uncreative ad for a brand and its product. The second group was shown a much more creative ad for the same brand and product. They then asked the group's questions about how they felt about the company that was advertising. Did they think the company was smart? Did they think the company would generally make high quality products? Did they think that overall this was a company worth purchasing from? The results showed that the group shown the more creative advertising thought much better of the company generally, that it was a smarter company that made better products and was more worthy of their patronage. The researchers found that the consumers understood that more creative advertising takes more talent and effort to produce. And they concluded that if the company put that much or that little talent and effort into their advertising, they probably put that much talent and effort into all the other things that they did too, like developing their products or delivering their service. When we choose to be more creative with our advertising, we don't just improve our chances of effectively communicating its message. We send a second and perhaps even louder message to consumers that we are a smarter company with better products, a company that takes pride in the things it does and strives for excellence. When we choose to be less creative, we communicate the opposite. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, a definition of creativity based on the qualities creative award judges look for when they're deciding whether to give a campaign an award. They're looking for campaigns that are original, engaging, and well executed. Those three qualities make up our definition of creativity. Second, that work with these creative award winning qualities is far more effective than work without those qualities. There is a mountain of evidence from a diverse range of sources proving that more creative campaigns and agencies are significantly more effective than their less creative counterparts. Thirdly, that the one area of creativity is less effective as in driving immediate spikes in sales. Like we saw in the long and short module, these very short term sales effects are best driven by more rational, informational, and offer driven advertising. But every other metric critical to the mid and long term growth of a business is much more effectively improved with a more creative and emotional approach. Lastly we've learned that creativity works by making advertising stand out more and be noticed, then by making it more memorable, then by making it more likely to be talked about and shared, then by making the message within it more persuasive, and lastly all of that adds up to creative ads being vastly more efficient and effective. Okay, so that's it for creativity and effectiveness. Remember to read through the workbook on today's session and if you have time, have a look at the extra content.
