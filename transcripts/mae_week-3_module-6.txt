 Hi there and welcome back to today's module on the power of emotion. You might have come out of the last module on mental availability and distinctive assets feeling like we could simply run ads consistently with our distinctive assets all over them and that would be enough to drive an effective outcome. Well, it would be better than running ads sporadically and having no one know what brand they were for for sure, but to really maximize the effectiveness of a brand's advertising, it's about more than just consistency and branding. It's about the two things that we're going to focus on over the next two modules, emotion and creativity. Up until now, we've pretty much been focused on the logic of effectiveness, you could say. Well, emotion and creativity are the magic. They're the things that give a brand more than just salience and comprehension. They're the things that give a brand warmth and personality and allow people to like it and choose it, not for rational reasons, but for irrational reasons. That's something that creates real value. It's easy for competitors to copy the rational stuff that customers buy you for. It's really hard for competitors to even analyze, let alone replicate the irrational bond you have with people if you manage to create one. Today, we're going to look at the power of emotion to drive advertising effectiveness and build brands, especially over the longer term. We're going to start by asking, what are we really trying to achieve when we use advertising to build brands? Not to drive immediate sales, but to build brands. The simplest answer is that we're trying to give people positive memories of the brand. The reason for that is that once they're ready to buy and our brand is put in front of them, we want them to remember us positively for those feelings that they have when they see our brand to be positive ones, to feel a sense of familiarity with us, a feeling that they can trust us, that they like us a little more than the other brands. We might think that it'd be better for them to recall some facts about our product and its benefits, but in reality, people just don't remember those things. There's a great quote from Maya Angelou. She said, I've learned that people will forget what you said. People will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. That's been proven out by research that shows that our memories of facts decay very quickly, whereas our memory of how something made us feel lasts much, much longer. That's very pertinent to building brands. We can bombard people with information, but they'll forget it, or we can make them feel something positive toward us, which they'll always remember. This isn't just theory. We're all aware that most advertising is rational and informational. It's brands telling us things that they want us to know about them or their product, and that some advertising is emotional. It tells us a story that makes us laugh or pulls at our heartstrings or inspires us. In the long and short of it, when Peter and Liz looked at the effectiveness of emotional and rational campaigns across the range of important effectiveness metrics, emotional campaigns outperformed rational campaigns across every one of them. If we look at the overall number of large business effects driven, emotional campaigns are more effective than rational ones. Whether it's sales, market share, pricing effects, or loyalty, emotional campaigns are more effective than rational ones. Those effects build more strongly over time than the effects of rational campaigns. When it comes to brand effects like growing awareness or trust or differentiation, emotional campaigns are more effective than rational ones. Again, those effects build more strongly over time for emotional campaigns. You might think that driving measures like trust and differentiation would be all about communicating how good the product was and how it was different. That's not what the evidence tells us. As Peter and Liz say, emotional campaigns generate much stronger effects despite the fact that they tend to say much less about product performance or benefits than rational campaigns. Consumers cannot help but believe better of brands that they feel emotionally closer to. And this is the wonderful trick of emotional brand building. When people feel emotionally close to us, that is they have strong positive emotions when they think of us, then they will conclude for themselves that our rational aspects are better. Without us needing to spend money telling them, they will assume that our products and services are better than others. And I want to really pause on that because it's such a critical thing to understand. When people feel emotionally close to our brand, they automatically assume our products and services are better. Not just the products and services we can afford to advertise, all of them. And that is brand Nirvana. If we have a brand where people just automatically believe that whatever we bring out will be a great product and probably better than the competitions, that's an amazing marketing superpower. It makes us more efficient. It means we're able to charge more. And therefore it makes us more profitable, which again is reflected in the data. Emotional campaigns are much more profitable than rational campaigns. And again, those effects compound over time much more for emotional campaigns. The evidence is really quite overwhelming that advertising that appeals to our emotions is much more effective than advertising that tries to persuade us with information. But how does that magic happen? Why do people assume something's rationally better just because they feel emotionally positive toward it? Well, it's because that's how the human mind works. We use how we feel as a shortcut past what we know. Up until this century, the theory was that the human brain was an information processing machine. It made decisions driven principally by facts, quickly making our for and against list of points of evidence and totting them up and reaching a logical conclusion. And that those decisions were only weakly influenced by emotions. However, huge advances in neuroscience and behavioral science this century have proven that this is not true. It's not the way we make decisions at all. Daniel Kahneman is the father of behavioral economics. He won the Nobel Prize in economics and he's the world's most respected expert on how and why humans make decisions. In his book, Thinking Fast and Slow, Kahneman uses his wealth of research to show that we think and make decisions in two very different ways. He calls these system one and system two thinking. When we're using system one thinking, we make decisions in a very fast, effortless, instinctive, and subconscious way. And we largely rest on our emotions, how we feel to make those decisions. When we're using system two thinking, we make decisions in a much more slow, effortful, logical and conscious way. And we largely rest on rational analysis, what we think and what we calculate to make those decisions. Kahneman has shown that we make around 95% of our decisions using system one thinking. The overwhelming amount of our decision making is subconscious and emotionally driven. When you think about this, it stands to reason. How many decisions do you make every day? From what to wear, to what to eat for breakfast, to whether or not to scratch the itch on your knee, to whether or not to spiral at a stranger, to which brand of wine you'll take home to have with dinner. You probably make hundreds if not thousands of decisions every day. If you needed to make a for and against list in your mind for every single decision, then work through those logically to reach a conclusion. It'll take you weeks to get through a single day. So to cope with life, we rely on our ability to make most decisions, including purchase decisions which we'll come to in a moment, intuitively, subconsciously and emotionally. Now it's not that we ignore our rational capabilities entirely. Our brain doesn't like to make rationally stupid decisions. So our system two thinking does a kind of sense check of our emotional decision to ensure it's not an entirely foolish one and rubber stamps that decision. And because the brain works in this way and in this order, we're more effective at getting people to decide to buy us if we communicate in that order. First, engage the emotions, enabling people to make the emotional decision to choose us. Second, provide just enough rational substantiation so that their logical brain can rubber stamp the decision as a good enough one. Which brings us back to the effectiveness of rational and emotional campaigns. As we saw earlier, emotional campaigns outperform rational campaigns across every measure, except for one. When it comes to driving immediate sales, those short term sales spikes the performance marketing is so good for, rational campaigns outperform emotional campaigns. This is because when we're actually ready to buy, we do use our system two thinking. That's the 5% of the decision making we do make with system two. And so it's best if we serve up what our system two brain wants in that particular moment, which is rational information, features, benefits, offers and calls to action. But again, remember that this is what we should be doing the minority of the time. The only people that the rational information is useful to is people who are in the market and ready to buy now. And they're the much smaller group. The much bigger group are those who will buy later, who have no use for and are not interested in information and offers just yet. They need to be left with a positive feeling about our brand so that when they are eventually ready to buy, they choose us. But even though that group is much bigger, as a marketing community, we're producing more and more advertising that's geared toward that much smaller group of people who are ready to buy now and want information. And a lot of industry data is showing that because of this, we're becoming less effective as an advertising community. One of the main causes of this is that advertising is becoming less and less emotional. We've seen how important emotion is to effectiveness. But over time, we've been taking the emotion out of advertising. One of the people who's interrogating the shift the most is Orlando Wood, who's the chief innovation officer at the market research company System One. That's right, his company is named after the form of thinking whereby we make most of our decisions. Orlando's written two books about how the style of advertising has evolved to appeal more to the left side of our brain, which is the side that works in a more rational way. And he summed up the books at CanLions in 2022 really well when he spoke alongside Peter Field and Karen Nelson Field about the decline in advertising effectiveness and the reasons for it. So I'm going to show you that presentation rather than just explaining Orlando's work because he's got a very unique way of presenting and exploring it. I think of him as a kind of effectiveness poet, and you'll see what I mean in a minute. Now, you might find this presentation a little bit strange at first, but stick with it and it'll all make sense by the end. Here's Orlando. So we have problems from a media perspective when it comes to establishing mental availability, but I think there might be something else as well. The opening scene from Death in Venice, directed by the great Lucchino Visconti. Just over 50 years ago, Visconti, with this film, won the 25th anniversary award here in Cannes. It was perhaps the pinnacle of his career. Visconti's filmmaking was known for its broad and long vistas, for its connection with the wider world, for its human vitality, for its life, for its sense of richness of space and clarity of space too, its flow, but also its subtlety of color. But then one evening in Rome in 1972, Visconti suffered a stroke. It affected the right-hand side of his brain and his left-hand side was paralyzed. But he continued to work. He needed to work. He needed work to give him impetus to live. And his films started to change. They looked very different. So gone are the broad vistas, the flow, the sense of movement, and instead we get something like this. This is the opening scene from his film, Lino Cente. Look at the abstracted hand here, turning the pages of a book. We get devitalized faces. We get a sequence of stares. And we get a sequence of what look like stills with symmetry and stasis. Why am I interested in Visconti? Well, because I think it tells us something of the nature of attention and what happens when it changes. But also because I think some of these features are discernible in advertising today, particularly the stare, the stare that coerces, just one of many features that have changed in the last 15 years that I think are undermining advertising's effectiveness. To understand attention, I look to the work of the brilliant neuroscientist, Ian McGillchrist. He's perhaps the world's expert on brain lateralization and the way that the two hemispheres of the brain pay attention to the world. It's not that the two halves of the brain do different things. It's that they do things differently, he explains. The left hemisphere is very narrow in its attention. It's very goal orientated. It abstracts things from their context, breaks them down into smaller parts, likes things to be explicit, no ambiguity. Cause and effect are the way it thinks. Repeatability is good. Literal and factual interpretations of the world can't really bear ambiguity. Things are right or wrong, true or false. So it's self-absorbed and dogmatic with an overly optimistic sense of the world. And it likes things, tools with which to manipulate the world. Language, signs and symbols are principles of these. And it's rather fixed. It likes things to be fixed, set in stone, unchanging, unmoving. And it can't really understand music, only very basic rhythm. The right hemisphere is very different. And the right hemisphere presents the world to us in the first place. It brings a kind of broad and vigilant attention to bear on the world. It sees everything in context, the whole if you like. If the left brain understands things and tools, the right brain empathizes. It understands people, their gestures, their movements, their intonation, their emphasis. It understands the whole world, in fact, as a series of connections and relationships. And it's open to novelty and contradiction. It can well believe that two opposing thoughts could both be true at the same time, which means it understands metaphor and it understands humor too. It's the right hemisphere that tells the difference between a joke and a lie. It's also very self-aware and questioning of its time and place in the world. And it's what gives us our sense of lived time, of space and of depth, that sense of flow and movement and our ability to appreciate music. Its individual voices as well as the whole unfolding in lived time. So let's talk about attention in a bit more detail. If I were to show you this figure here, the chances are you'd see it as age four before you saw all the e's and the eights. And that's because the right hemisphere which presents the world to us in the first place brings a kind of broad beam attention to bear on the world. It means it looks after alertness and sustained attention which ground us in the world and the people in it. It's vigilant to things that are happening just at the edge of our awareness, just off stage and it helps us with divided attention too. And anything of interest, it passes to the left hemisphere for this narrow beam attention to be brought to bear. The e's and the eights here in my example. Well in the last 15 years or so as we have been increasingly looking downward and inward at our devices, I think we've been losing this broad beam attention. We've been spending more and more of our time on this narrow beam attention, bringing new habits of thinking into play which are certainly evident in culture, in society, but also too in advertising and advertising style. I'll tell you something else about the two hemispheres. The right hemisphere is better connected to the limbic system which helps us to experience emotion. It's also more associated with episodic memory, memory of people, events, things in our lives, episodes. On the left, the left hemisphere is better associated with semantic memory, memory of facts and figures in the public domain. So this gives us our first clue as to the type of advertising that might be of interest to the right hemisphere, to the presencing right hemisphere. I'm going to show you an ad now and I'm going to show you because I think it was created some years ago now as Peter says to capture this broad beam attention. Let's have a look. I walked about a bit on my own. Oh no. I strolled around without anyone else. Oh dear, oh dear. I wandered lonely as a clown that floats on high or veils and hills. Only Heineken can do this because it refreshes the points other beards cannot reach. William Wordsworth reimagined from the Refreshes the Parts campaign. But you'll have noticed there the broad vistas, the music, the characterization and the voice, the humour, the metaphor. I'm going to show you an ad now which I think is designed and created, conceived for narrow beam attention. Introducing Budweiser Zero. Zero percent alcohol, zero grams of sugar, full Budweiser flavour. A refreshing alcohol free brew that tastes like the real thing. Budweiser Zero, zero compromise. Did you notice how close up we were in that? It's the e's and the eight's in my example. So we have advertising here I think created for broad beam attention that assumes no inherent interest in the brand or product but that seeks to create it. And we have advertising on the left here which I think already assumes some kind of interest in the brand and seeks to nudge people towards a purchase, what we might call performance advertising on the left and brand building advertising on the right. And it's towards this kind of advertising on the left that we have been gradually drifting over the last 15 years or so. To advertising that looks a bit like this. Note how close up we are to everything. The hands, the mouth, the lips, the eyes. Things don't happen in live time. It's atomised into short sharp cuts. We get a very rhythmic sense to the whole thing not just in the soundtracks but also in the way that the visuals are put together. They're dislocated from time and place. Where are these things set? They're not happening in live time. Everything looks rather self-conscious. Quite different from the sort of advertising we saw 30, 40 years ago. Some examples on the right here. Clear sense of place. People reacting to each other, interacting with dialogue, rooted in a place that we might recognise. A sense of betweenness. Sense of connection with the world and the wider world. When I researched this I looked back at advertising features for the last 30 years or so. I looked at their ability to connect with audiences. Emotional response. Emotional response is important because it captures our attention but it also lodges things in long term memory. I looked at the ability of features that we might associate with the right and left hemispheres to connect with people emotionally. I found that it was the right hemisphere features, characters, place, people doing things in a place that were much more likely to engage people emotionally. These left brain features unable to do that. Repetition, soundtracks that are very rhythmic. This kind of close up abstraction. Words on the screen. The problem is that when you look back at what's been happening over the last 30 years, it's these most effective features, these right brain features that are becoming less common and these left brain features that are becoming more common. When did this happen? Well it happened in around 2006 when we see this wholesale swing away from whole brained or even slightly right brained advertising towards left brained advertising in the ascendance and dominance now. What about the implications of this for attention? Well working with the company T-vision in the states who monitor advertising's ability to capture attention as people watch it on television and it plays out in people's homes. I looked at a number of features we might say were associated with the left hemisphere and this narrow beam attention. So the abstraction I've talked about, monologues and so on, this rhythmic quality, that facial frontality, that stare even. And I've looked at features that we might associate with the right hemisphere here. Character incident and place essentially, something happening between people in a relatable place. I've looked at that, these features and their ability both to capture attention in the advertising that they're involved in and to elicit an emotional response. And what we find using system one's emotional response data is that it's these right brained features that are most likely to capture attention to elicit emotional response. Characters, animals, people, the living in other words, doing something interesting in a place. And it's these left brained features that push people away, that cause them to detach. So you might think, well perhaps there's some bearing here on advertising effectiveness. Well, you'd be right. Working with Peter, we looked at the IPA's database and we looked at the ability of campaigns that you might consider as right brained in the features that they enjoyed against those that were more left brained. And we found that it was the right brained campaigns that generated sales effects, profit gain, share gain. These large lasting effects. And they do it because they're much better able to lodge the brand in long term memory. Much better able to make your brand jump to mind, leap to mind before any other from the Latin celerae to leap. Problem is, of course, that this creative dividend is lost on poor attention media. So we might conclude that when it comes to creative development, the focused attention of the brain's left hemisphere perhaps oughtn't be your focus of attention as a marketeer. We need instead advertising with wit and charm, advertising with human vitality, advertising that entertains. Perhaps a bit like the campaign I'm about to show you, which was conceived for pre-roll, one of the better attention performing online video environments.

So from the three of us here today, we might politely suggest that if you want sales, salience and lasting effects, it's brand building advertising that you need for broad beam attention on attention rich media. From the three of us, thank you very much. I really love Orlando's thinking and the way he's calling us back to having more humanity in advertising. Eliciting emotion and building emotional closeness to our brand are the most effective things we can do to make our business bigger and more competitive and more profitable. And as Orlando said, characters, animals, people, the living in other words, doing something interesting in a place. It's these right brain features that are most likely to capture attention and elicit an emotional response. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly that emotional campaigns are much more effective in every way. Brand growth, commercial growth, and especially profitability. The only exception as we learned in the long and short module is campaigns seeking only to drive immediate success. Emotional campaigns are slightly less effective in that regard. So it's okay to do a pretty rational product or price ad from time to time, but most of the time we should be trying to get some kind of emotional response. Secondly, that emotional campaigns are more effective because our human brains make most decisions emotionally and intuitively. It's much more important that people feel emotionally good about us than they have a list of facts about us in their head. We learned that when people feel emotionally close to a brand, they automatically assume that a brand's products and services are better. And finally, we learned that the creative style that's been becoming so much more prevalent in advertising is taking us further away from emotion and is contributing to the decline in advertising's effectiveness because of that. But now that you know that and your competitors don't, you can use emotional creative to get one over them. That's it for today's module. Remember to read through the workbook on today's session. And if you have time, take a look at the extra content. And if you've got questions about the content in today's session, leave those in the comments section of this page. We'll endeavor to answer those either here on the page or in the next live session. And I'll look forward to seeing you again for module seven.
