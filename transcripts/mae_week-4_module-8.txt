 Hi there, and welcome back into today's module, Creative Commitment. Today we're going to look at three variables of campaigns, how much money is spent on them, how long they're run for, and how many media they're spread out across, and how these variables impact on campaign effectiveness. We're going to go behind the scenes on one of the best and most effective ever advertising campaigns, and how it used those variables to drive its extraordinary results. And we're going to look at what makes small budget campaigns more effective. So when we can't change that budget variable, we can still maximize the effectiveness of the budget we do have. So let's get into it. In 2019, along with CanLions and WALK, I did a major study of advertising effectiveness between 2010 and 2019. We wanted to learn what was effective in the most recent decade when the marketing landscape had become so different to what it had been in decades past. What could we learn about effectiveness in a world of influencer marketing, Facebook conversion ads, in-game advertising, content marketing, and other tech-driven concepts that really didn't exist much at all before 2010? We looked at all of the case studies we had in both the WALK effectiveness database and the Can Creative Effectiveness Lions database, and found nearly 5,000 cases from that time period and from every major category and market in the world. The first thing we found was that creatively awarded campaigns remain much more effective than campaigns without those creative award-winning qualities. Between 2010 and 2019, creatively awarded campaigns were much more likely to be effective enough to win an effectiveness award and much more likely to win a better quality of effectiveness award. So, even with all that's changed since that work of Peter Fields back in 2011, we're still best to begin with work with creative award-winning qualities. Then once we have a campaign idea in place, we have choices to make about what we commit to the campaign in terms of media budget, in terms of the length of time we run and market, and in terms of the number of media channels we spread the campaign out across. So we wanted to look at those factors and understand how they contributed to effectiveness. And what we found was that campaigns became more effective when any of those factors increased. As media spend increases, so does effectiveness. Here we can see that the campaigns with lower spend of under a million dollars are much less effective than those with spend over five million dollars. As campaign duration increases, so does effectiveness. Here we can see that the campaigns that ran for under three months weren't as effective as campaigns that ran for more than six months. And as the number of media channels we use increases, so does effectiveness. Here we can see that those campaigns that use four or fewer media channels aren't as effective as those that spread out over 11 or more. And so we began to think of those factors as dimensions of what we called creative commitment. The amount of money or time or media channels that get committed to a creative idea. And because we had that information for most of the campaigns in our database, we realised that we could give any campaign an overall creative commitment score by combining their various levels of spend, duration and number of media channels. The scoring is pretty simple. A campaign gets one point if they're in the lowest spend band, up to five if they're in the highest. One point if they're in the lowest duration band, up to five if they're in the highest. And one point if they're in the lowest number of media channels band, and up to five if they're in the highest. So every campaign has a score of between three and 15. For example, the John Lewis Christmas campaign. It's run every year for over a decade now. It always has pretty high spend and it's always spread out across lots of different media channels. So that gets a high creative commitment score of 14. Google's Year of Search campaign in Russia in 2017, it ran quickly around the end of year period in just one media, and they spent very little on it. So it gets the lowest possible creative commitment score of three. The It's a Tide Ad campaign, like most campaigns, is somewhere in the middle. That campaign had a low duration around the Super Bowl. It used a medium number of different media, and it had a high media spend. So it gets a creative commitment score of nine. Once we'd given all of the campaigns in our database a creative commitment score, we could look at how those scores related to effectiveness. And what we found when we did the analysis was quite remarkable. An almost perfect linear relationship between creative commitment and effectiveness. As we increase creative commitment, we increase effectiveness. This was quite an exciting finding, but although we were looking at a pretty big robust data set, you're looking at about three and a half thousand cases in that chart. We wanted to know whether this principle of creative commitment held true elsewhere. So I asked Peter Field if he'd look at his IPA databank for the same period and assign each case a creative commitment score and see if those scores related to his measures of effectiveness in the same way they had for us. So Peter went away and did his analysis, and he found that indeed in his separate data set, and with the more sophisticated questions he could ask that data set, the results were identical. Peter measures overall effectiveness in terms of the number of very large business effects created by the campaigns. Sales, market share, profitability, those commercial effectiveness metrics. As we can see, as creative commitment increases, so does overall effectiveness. With the IPA data, Peter can also drill down into specific effects, like penetration gains, which you'll remember from the targeting for growth module are very important to a brand's growth. Again, we see penetration growth increase as creative commitment increases. He can look at market share growth, and again we see a very linear correlation between creative commitment and market share gains. And he looked at profit growth and saw the same general pattern. At very, very high spend, we find that the media spend begins to eat into profit, hence the drop on that last bar. But the story is generally the same. Low creative commitment campaigns are far less likely to drive profitable growth. And so this is how we arrived at the principle of creative commitment, which holds that advertising campaigns generate larger and more efficient commercial returns as they're run for longer durations, spread out across more media channels, and given greater media spend. Using any of these three variables gives campaigns an effectiveness advantage. And that's the interesting finding here. We have three levers that we can pull to improve the effectiveness of campaigns. We can spend more money on them, or we can spread them out across longer duration, or we can spread them out across more media. Any of those three levers will improve the effectiveness of our campaign. But instead of pulling those levers, we've been doing the opposite. When we look at the global average creative commitment of campaigns between 2010 and 2019, we see a dramatic reduction since 2014. As an industry, we're spending less on each campaign. We're running them for shorter durations, and we're spreading them across fewer media. The evidence is very clear that when we reduce creative commitment, we reduce the effectiveness of our campaigns. And so what will have been happening over the past decade is a significant erosion in the overall effectiveness of advertising. This is a problem for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the obvious reason that we won't be seeing the same return on investment from our campaigns. But the other more serious reason is that we'll be damaging the overall value of marketing, especially if we're in an environment where there's skepticism over the value of marketing. By reducing the creative commitment of our work, we'll only be confirming those skepticism by delivering poorer results. And so it's critical that we turn this around for the good of marketing and marketers everywhere. But there's also a competitive advantage in knowing about creative commitment ahead of your competitors. It gives you the opportunity to win by increasing your creative commitment as they continue to decrease theirs. Now, we're going to take a break from the charts and data for a moment now and take a look at one of the world's best high creative commitment campaigns from this century. It's the Snickers You're Not You When You're Hungry campaign. And in this video, you'll hear from all of the people behind that work telling the story of how they built a platform that has been able to run for so many years and in so many different markets and across so many different media channels and use that high creative commitment to do amazing things for the Snickers brand and business. Take a look. In 2010, Snickers launched a new campaign with a Super Bowl ad in the US and it was an instant success. It not only rejuvenated the brand, but it became a global platform activated in more than 70 countries worldwide. Shut up mom! You must be supermodels, right? What are you modeling, gloves? Sweetheart, I left my phone in. I'm having phone issues. Bye. Come on man. Hey, what? We said pantyhose, right? Zip it, Shrimpy. Can you feel that? Just help with your girlfriend, Sal. Baby. Eat a Snickers. Better? Better. Yeah, I got it. What the hell is it? Hey guys. What's up? We're at the hole. The Snickers hole. It's working. It's won many awards, including 47 canned lines and it catapulted Snickers from the number seven bar brand to the number one bar brand worldwide. You're Not You and You're Hungry has been called the greatest global advertising campaign of all time and it all started the day we fired BBDO. That's right. Snickers fired us. Back in the mid 2000s, the brand had lost its way and we were kind of part of the problem. We were doing work that was too bro-ey, like vertically bro-ey. That was the target, but Snickers is a horizontal brand and we kind of left out everybody else. Snickers isn't just a brand for teen guys. It's a brand that everyone loves. So what we needed was a big global campaign idea, an idea that was universal, that was going to remind everyone just how good a Snickers bar can be. So a few years later, the brand gave us another chance and this time we had learned our lesson. We definitely were going to get it right this time. We were going to make Snickers relevant again with a big global campaign that appealed to a much broader audience. To do that, we chose to return to a product truth that Snickers had always stood for, hunger satisfaction. Snickers satisfies you. Nothing satisfies like Snickers. It's a good solid snack. So that was the brief. It was October 2009. We found out the clients had purchased a 30 second ad in the upcoming Super Bowl. We really had no time at all. You don't always get a brief where the problem the product solves is so real and relatable. So hunger was a nice place to start. We explored a lot of ways into it and one of the ways we landed on was this idea that when you're hungry, your personality changes. Some people became short tempered, others became lightheaded and loopy. So as we were talking about how to bring this idea to life in a Super Bowl spot, we thought about celebrities and realized how many celebrities actually embodied the traits of hungry people. You had your divas, your hotheads. And of course there was nothing new about using celebrities on Super Bowl, but usually they're used in a more aspirational way. So we thought it would be interesting to kind of flip that and use these people to represent the negative. So we started writing scripts where we had specific celebrities representing the alter egos of hungry people. And we thought the juxtaposition of seeing these larger than life people in these mundane scenes with random dudes had potential to be pretty funny. And as we were writing these stories that kind of led us pretty obviously to the line that would sum it up, which was you're not you and you're hungry. I saw the line before I saw any work and the line alone, it communicated the insight in such a human great way. I thought this isn't just a campaign line. This is a platform that's going to lead us into the future. Like I just the hairs on my neck went up. The idea that hunger changes your personality is actually true. It's really in my experience. And it's you know, it's true everywhere in the world and to every kind of person. And given the equity that Snickers has and had over decades, really in the hunger satisfaction space, it felt like a pretty natural place to go and try to do something distinctive for the brand reaching out to celebrities at first was daunting. We just weren't sure if they were going to be interested in representing themselves as the problem in the commercials. Luckily, we landed with Betty and Aretha, both the people who understood that it was really about honoring them and they did a great job of embracing it and getting it on the joke. Working with Betty White was amazing. I didn't know what I was getting into having to ask an 88 year old woman to lay down and in a cold, wet, muddy puddle. But she did it happily and the person laid on top of her. We filmed the scene and when he got up, she looked at him in her charming way and said, usually somebody buys me a drink before they do that. Mike, what is your deal? Come on, man. You've been riding me all day. You're playing like Betty White out there. That's not what your girlfriend said. Eat a Snickers. Better? Better. That hurt. You're not you when you're hungry. Snickers satisfies. We had high hopes, but the ad was more successful than we'd ever imagined. It won the ad meter, which was at the time the only ranking for Super Bowl that really mattered. It revitalized Betty's career and it also revitalized Snickers. So all the clients around the world were excited to take it. And it did spread like wildfire around the world and it really caught on. But I think the beauty of it was we didn't do what is usually done, which is you kind of parachute some American campaign into another country and it feels like foreign. Here they took the idea, but in Turkey and Russia and China, everywhere they did their own bespoke versions of it with their own celebrities, with insights we could never have known. So it really felt homegrown. You can't concentrate when you're hungry. Eat a Snickers. Better? And like with every good marriage, it's not a good marriage. VVideo worked with their local clients collaboratively around the world to bring the campaign to life using local celebrities and cultural references that they knew would resonate in their markets. And it worked. In the first year alone, You're Not You and You're Hungry helped grow global sales by 15.9% and it grew market share in 56 of the 58 markets where it ran. This idea is relevant to so many people in so many different situations that it makes it incredibly flexible. We can all identify with moments where hunger has caused us to be off our game. Since third grade, are you looking at it? I wouldn't have the candy. We're not good enough for you. You must be supermodels. What do you model? Gloves? Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. Jan, this isn't about you. It never is. Can we turn the A seat up? I'm dying back here. It's on. Can't you feel it? Can you feel that? Oh, Jeff, eat a Snickers, please. Every time you get hungry, you turn into a diva. Just eat it so we can all coexist in here. And this allows us to create work that makes the brand relevant and top of mind in an almost limitless number of occasions. One strength of the idea is its simplicity. And it was really easy for consumers to pick up on it. And it wasn't long until they started creating their own versions of the idea and taking it to all the places we couldn't go. Feel better? Yeah. So we started with a great global TV campaign. But we knew we had this platform. What's great about a platform is it's bendy and stretchy enough to go wherever the world needs it to as new things are introduced and new things reveal themselves. So technologies came that we couldn't fathom when we first did the campaign, but the campaign was able to embrace and go with it. At the time, we didn't have the big budgets to produce TV in the UK. So we were forced to come up with a new and less traditional way of introducing you're not you into our market. So we looked at a place that hadn't been looked at before and a place that marketeers hadn't been into. And that place was celebrity Twitter. We managed to get some of the UK's biggest celebrities to post tweets that were completely out of character. And then later reveal that they they just weren't themselves. And all they needed was a snipper. Come to something when Katie Price's tweets make more sense on the economy than the Labour Front bench. On a budget of 85,000 pounds, it got 850,000 pounds worth of attention for the brand. So the lesson there is that as these new technologies are being introduced, most people just do cut downs or versions of the TV. But since we weren't dependent on any TV execution because it was a platform, we were able to take each technology and do something unique for it. On Google, we bought misspelled search words to reach hungry people every time they made a spelling mistake to remind them you can't spell when you're hungry. We worked with Google to create an algorithm of common misspellings of their top 500 search terms and reached over half a million people in two days. On Twitch, we showed gamers what they were like when they were hungry during a live stream. Snickers partnered up with Trump SC, Serious Gaming and Dingle-Durper, some of the most popular gamers on Twitch. As they got hungry, they started making mistakes. No! How did you miss that? And the hungrier they got, the more they warped into different characters. I'm acting weird, I'm completely fine. Unbelievable. The Twitch community knew something was up. Then they ate a Snickers hunger bar and went back to being themselves. We put symptoms on packs so friends could call each other out. And in Brazil, we had one of the biggest stars on the national soccer team support Argentina and it blew up the internet with WTF Ronaldo until it was revealed that he was hungry and he was not himself and a Snickers sorted him out. We found ways to be more narrow and relevant to specific audiences like students in China. There is a big exam that 90 million Chinese students must take every year and they can't let hunger get in their way. So we partnered with a very famous boy band, TF Boys, and introduced personified hunger monsters to represent what happens when the students aren't themselves because they're too hungry. We even found a way to bring the campaign idea to a place that creators often thumb their nose at, the in-store retail promotion. We turned a traditional in-store brief into a world first real-time digital campaign that converted online behaviors into offline sales called the hunger rhythm. An algorithm that monitored the mood of the internet and adjusted the price of Snickers accordingly. Built on a 3000-word lexicon from MIT, the hunger rhythm analyzed over 14,000 posts and updated the price of Snickers over 140 times a day across all 7-11 stores. So the angrier the internet, the cheaper the Snickers. It grew sales for Snickers by over 67% and has been successfully rolled out around the world. Australia, get angry. Let's get those things down to 3 cents. That is the best thing ever. Even within the film work, we always find ways to evolve and adapt to keep the thing fresh. We did a deep fake of an old Brady Bunch episode before there was even a word deep fake. Marsha, eat a Snickers. Why? You get a little hostile when you're hungry. We did a whole out of sorts integration of a TV show. Watched by millions daily, the Dave TV channel is famous for its funny, high-energy, action-packed programs. But what happened when Dave got hungry? Dave became... Rupert. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. You join us here at the International Chess Championships. The big advantage of having a highly recognizable campaign idea is that, you know, success doesn't rely on some superficial thing. Like a celebrity spokesperson or a musical sting or a design element. You know, the work hangs together on a truly on an idea that carries into different contexts and still feels like it has integrity. And I think some of the proof for me in this campaign is in some of the work we just did on Super Bowl, the latest iteration of the Snickers campaign, where I think, again, that idea carried all the way through. Texting while walking. The sudden surge of scooters. An artist has duct taped a banana to a wall and is selling it for six figures. Check this out. The largest Snickers bar in the world was just made at a candy factory in Texas. The largest chocolate nut bar ever. And this bar is going to be leading up into the gigantic momentum during a Super Bowl. From the ground up, it was a whole new expression of you're not you. In this case, calling out a whole world that was out of sorts. Well, it's out of sorts as we thought things could be back in 2019. I dig because suddenly people think it's okay to talk on speakerphone in public. What was that? Oh, nothing. Just some lady digging a giant hole. But be it Snickers, we're digging a huge hole. It's a huge hole. Dropping it right in. It's something to do. So done with the works we all win. It looks nothing like the Betty White spot. But the idea, the humor and the product is hero. Well, that's still all there. So an idea that's been around for a decade has obviously been touched by many, many clients and a variety of agency people from all around the world. So we had to create a set of guidelines to judge the work by. We wanted to make sure the work always felt consistent. Importantly, that it felt like Snickers and that it never got cookie cutter. The first is, if you wouldn't talk to your friends at the pub about it, it isn't funny enough. If you wouldn't tell your grandmother about it, it isn't inclusive enough. And if it isn't easily explained, then it isn't simple enough. The thing that makes working at Snickers exciting is also what makes it hard. That you look and see all the cool ways that people have brought this campaign to life and you realize it has limitless potential. Which means when you're thinking about it, you have to explore every avenue, every new media channel. And just when you think it's all been done, some other team from somewhere around the world has found a whole new way again. It helps to have a client who believes in the power of humor. With the state of the world today, a lot of clients are shying away from it. But if you're telling a story that's real and grounded and not going for a cheap laugh, people appreciate it. I have to do a little pinch. Sweetheart, I left my phone in. I'm having phone issues. Bye. The important thing is that I'm going to make you better. Okay, here's how to make butter. Pour two-thirds cup cold heavy cream into a one. Are we on yet? Um... I thought we were doing a Zoom thing. So my biggest lesson so far from the success of You're Not You is that the best work out there is limited by language or trends or culture. It stands the test of time because it unites a universal human insight with an enduring product truth. And an idea like that can work in any country. It can work in any language. It can adapt to changing media habits, to different buying behaviors, to whatever budget the client wants to throw at us. It's what truly makes it limitless and be able to extend way into the future. The most important takeaway for me, um, a big global campaign doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. If the idea is universal and big enough, you can activate it locally to be relevant and funny to all kinds of different audiences. I guess what I want to leave people with is this. When you are given the gift of a great creative idea that works, commit to it. Um, the evidence that we've seen on Snickers and on many other campaigns, as you all have, is that when you stick with a great idea, um, as I say, commit to it, invest in it over time. And I think that's key. Invest in it on a regular, repeatable basis. Um, your odds of success are increased exponentially, and the chance of long-term impact, um, and growth, um, are multiplied. And that was certainly our experience on Snickers. Snickers is such a great story, with so much to take inspiration from. But they had a lot of scope and a good amount of money to begin with, more than most of us. So what about creative commitment at the smaller end of the scale? One of the main challenges with increasing creative commitment is budget. It's not always possible to just get bigger budgets for campaigns right away. If we look at how per campaign spend is tracked over the last decade, it's pretty ugly. One way to turn this around without increasing overall budgets is to do fewer larger campaigns rather than lots of very small ones. But if we're still stuck with a small budget, we've done some more analysis to discover how to use creative commitment to your advantage. And what we've found is that the choices we instinctively make when we work with smaller budgets are actually the wrong ones. There are three key assumptions that most of us make when we have a smaller budget. The first is that it's better not to spread ourselves too thin. We feel that to get maximum bang for bucketed, it'd be better to concentrate our spend into a short duration and fewer media. The second assumption is that we'd be better to use more cost-effective digital media than more expensive traditional media. We go for media like content marketing, social influencer, online display. And the third assumption is that it's better not to get too clever and go for a more informational, rational approach rather than a more creative and emotional one. So let's look at what the data tells us when we test these assumptions. First up, let's look at how creative commitment correlates with effectiveness when we take budget out of the picture. What this chart shows is that budget is not the controlling factor. It isn't the case that campaigns simply get more effective as we spend more on them. What we see here is that regardless of budget, campaigns get more effective as they run for longer and are spread out across different media. Where these lines flatline at the top, what this is telling us is, yes, at a certain point, we need to add budget to continue seeing increases. But regardless of budget, campaigns with low duration and few media channels are the least effective of all. And what I'm going to do now is show you creative commitment and effectiveness at different budget levels. Let's start with the big budget campaigns of over 5 million. Where there are bars missing on these charts means the data is too small to be robust. But here we can see with big budgets, the principle of creative commitment holds true. We'll be more effective if we run longer and spread out across more media channels. What about budgets of between 1 and 5 million? Same story. Between 500K and 1 million? Same again. And at our lowest spend bracket, campaigns under 500K? Well, here the increase in effectiveness as we increase creative commitment is the greatest of all. And I want to break down what this is telling us in detail because it's surprising and important. Our instinctive assumption would be that on low budgets, it's better to concentrate those budgets into short durations and fewer media. It feels like if we spread a small budget out across a whole year or across seven or eight different media, we'd spread so thin that we'd end up being invisible. But the data shows quite the opposite. Those low budget campaigns that are concentrated into short durations and few media are the least effective of all. And the small budget campaigns that have run long and wide are the most effective. So if we're stuck with a small budget, actually the best thing we can do is run for a longer duration and use more media channels. So that's assumption number one about working with smaller budgets. The second assumption was that we'd be better to use more cost-effective digital media than more expensive traditional media, media like content marketing, social influencer or online display. What we see in the data is that a larger group of small budget campaigns do indeed lead with these media. But it's the campaigns that lead with more traditional media that are more effective and not just a little more effective. They're twice as effective. We're simply not seeing the kinds of effectiveness results from those cheaper digital media than we see from more traditional media, even when we're working with smaller budgets. And how about that third assumption that it's best not to get too clever and go for a more informational, rational approach rather than a creative and emotional one? Well, again, we can see that small budget campaigns are indeed mostly more rational than emotional, but the emotional ones are more effective. Of course, this ties in with the findings in the long and short module where we saw that emotional work outperforms rational work across just about every effectiveness metric. So when we're working with a small budget, it's still in our best interest to communicate in a way that engages people's emotions. And lastly, how about creativity on a budget? When we're working with small budgets, is it best to go for campaigns with creative award-winning qualities? Well, firstly, as we saw in the last module, if you're just trying to drive an immediate sales spike, then you're probably better with an informational, offer-driven approach that's less creative. But if you're trying to build the brand and grow the business, then yes, creatively awarded work at low budgets far outperforms uncreative work. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, that we're most effective when we start with a campaign with creative award-winning qualities and maximize spend, duration and number of media channels used. But perversely, as an industry, we are significantly reducing creative commitment, which will be making our campaigns less effective and damaging the overall value of marketing. On smaller budgets, we're better to spread across longer durations and more media channels. Concentrating for bang for buck is false logic. And on smaller budgets, we're better to use emotion and lead with more traditional media. Rational campaigns using cost-effective media are not more effective. So that's it for today's module on creative commitment. Remember to read through the workbook on the session today. And if you've got time, have a look at the extra content.
