 Well, hi there and a big welcome to the Master of Advertising Effectiveness program. My name is James Herman and I'm so glad you could join me for this program where I'm going to share with you the knowledge that I've gained over 20 years of practicing, researching, publishing and teaching advertising effectiveness. When I started out in advertising, we didn't have the same abundance of effectiveness data that we do today. And so while there were people who studied advertising effectiveness and plenty of people with strong opinions about what works and what didn't, there was hardly ever much data to back it up. But since then, we've come a really long way. We've had independent institutions like the UK's Institute of Practitioners in Advertising or IPA and the Ehrenberg Bass Institute of Marketing Science, WALK and CanLions have all made valuable contributions to understanding how advertising works using the huge amounts of data they've amassed over decades of collecting case studies and marketing intelligence. Researchers like Peter Field and Liz Burnett, Byron Sharp and Jenny Romaniak, Grace Kite and Orlando Wood have uncovered patterns in that data that provide us with a much clearer understanding of what works and why it works. And we'll be covering much of their research and findings throughout the program. I've spent many years contributing my own research too, especially in the area of creative effectiveness and I'll be sharing that too. What I hope to give you in this program is a complete view of the key principles of advertising effectiveness, bringing all of those different strands from different researchers together into a kind of unified theory of effectiveness. And I can do that because those principles are all complementary. They don't argue with each other. Instead, they build on each other and come together to provide a really well-rounded answer to fundamental questions like how does advertising work and how do I make it work better, more consistently and more predictably? One of the things I've noticed when working with huge datasets of campaigns spanning decades is just how common it is for brands to win the occasional effectiveness award. Look at the last 10 years and pretty much any brand you can think of will have made a campaign that was so successful that it ended up winning an EFI or an IPA or a WALK or Canline's effectiveness award. But what's far rarer is brands that consistently win these awards. There are barely any brands that year in, year out produce advertising that's highly effective. It often feels like advertising is uncertain and fickle, that it's all a little out of our control. Like we end up being highly effective when the stars just seem to align. But what I want to give you is the ability to align the stars yourself rather than waiting and hoping for them to align. What's also been important to me in designing this program is that I teach you scientifically robust and evidence-based principles. What I mean by that is that I'm not teaching you what I think or what my personal experience making advertising has taught me. These aren't James's reckons on advertising. And they're not spurious conclusions drawn from looking at a handful of anecdotal examples. What I'll teach you are principles that have been developed from the analysis of major advertising effectiveness data sets by the world's leading independent marketing science, academics, and researchers. These data sets are real world data drawn from thousands of case examples from major brands and advertising campaigns from every major market in the world. Importantly, the only principles I'll teach you are those that have been validated in a scientifically robust way. That means that these principles have not been drawn from a single researcher looking at a single data set. Everything I'll teach you has been proven out over time by multiple researchers using independent data sets, meaning that the principles are objectively robust and replicable. These principles have been developed mostly using data from commercial, for-profit brands and companies, mostly in the B2C space. This doesn't mean that they're not as relevant to public service or charity or B2B brands and campaigns. In fact, Peter, Liz, me, and the Ehrenberg Bass Institute have all worked with the LinkedIn B2B Institute in recent years to research whether these principles hold in B2B. And we've all found that they do. And I believe that the principles are all just as applicable in not-for-profit environments, although what we think of as commercial outcomes might be languaged a little differently. The data and examples are also mostly from pretty well-known larger brands in more mature categories, the kinds of brands we typically see running national campaigns in above-the-line media. To be honest, there's not a lot of data available for very small brands or young startup companies. But that doesn't mean that if you're working with smaller brands, the principles can't be applied in a scaled-down way to improve the effectiveness of your advertising. Now, these principles, they are principles more than their hard laws. At many points in the program, I bet you'll find yourself thinking of outliers, of examples of brands or campaigns that haven't adhered to these principles and have still been successful, or of situations you can think of where it doesn't make sense that these rules would apply. And that's totally fine. It's not accountancy. It's not equations and algorithms. It's much more nuanced. There are always going to be outliers. The brand you work on might be an outlier. And a good degree of advertising effectiveness comes down to our ability as practitioners to assess the situation and make the right call on whether to follow the rules or depart from them. But it sure helps to know what the rules are, to understand them, so that we can make much more informed and strategic decisions when we do feel we should break them. Over the next few weeks, we'll be digging into these different rules or principles. We'll be looking at the research and the data behind them. We'll look at examples of campaigns that illustrate the principles. During each week, you'll be looking at a couple of modules, and throughout the program, we'll have live sessions where we'll dig into your questions about what you're learning. Now, what I'd like you to do for each module is to watch the video, but then go back through the workbook, which covers what you learned in the video. This will assist in the principles really sinking in, hearing it from me, but then having a chance to read for yourself, spend a bit more time thinking about the areas that you don't immediately understand. And while you're doing that, I want you to write down questions for the live sessions. Anything you don't quite understand or want to explore further, note that down and then submit a question for one of the live sessions. I'll be reviewing your questions and bringing answers to those sessions. In each module, there's a few additional resources. Papers, videos, podcasts, extra case studies. Think of these as extras for experts. They'll deepen your understanding of what's been discussed in that module, but they're not compulsory, and the exam won't contain questions about them. But I'd really encourage you to get into as much of the additional resources as you can. It's all really excellent content, and you'll be better for consuming it. So with that housekeeping out of the way, I want to get into the topic for today, which is how advertising works to build brands and businesses. And I want to start with a slightly unusual question, which is, does advertising work? Now this might seem like a weird question to ask. Of course advertising works. Why would millions of companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars on it every year if it didn't? There's a question that people actually do ask. Sometimes those people work in the same company as us, and sometimes they're famous economists, like the authors of Freakonomics who did a podcast where they looked at one piece of research and concluded very entertainingly but very wrongly that advertising doesn't work at all. But given people do ask whether advertising works, it's an important question to be able to answer. One thought experiment tends to be, what would happen if we just turned off all of our advertising? Would our sales plummet? Or would nothing at all happen? Would we sell just as much but be far more profitable? Many of us have probably wondered that at some point. And of course it's way too scary an experiment for most of us to try. But at the Ehrenberg Bass Institute, they actually do have data on a whole 57 companies who cut all mass media advertising for a year or longer. And what happened to them? So they can actually see the real world effects of that thought experiment. And what they found was really interesting. Firstly they found that sales decreased considerably but didn't plummet straight away. On average sales dropped by about 16% in that first year, which tells us that current advertising isn't driving all of a company's current sales. We're going to spend a lot of time on the longer term effects of advertising on this program but for now let's accept that some things those companies did before the year they cut their advertising meant that their sales didn't decline catastrophically straight away. But of course the declines continued over time until the point about 7 to 10 years later when those companies were making about one third of the sales that they used to make when they were advertising. So this is a pretty clear argument for the value of advertising. It's a perfect experiment where advertising was there then it was taken away and we can see a very demonstrable reduction in sales over time across many different types of companies and many different industries. So we know that advertising works. It does something. If we don't have it we don't sell as much. Pretty simple. And what this program is about is how it works and what we can do to make it work better. So strap in and let's address that first question. How does advertising work? And here's where I'm going to introduce a way of thinking about advertising that's based upon the most important data and findings of the effectiveness community over the past two decades. Particularly the work published in the IPAs long and short of it and the Ehrenberg Bass Institute's How Brands Grow. The framework is built on the evidence that advertising works in two ways and the language I'm going to use is firstly how advertising works and secondly how advertising campaigns work. Now that distinction might sound a bit strange at first but bear with me. When we think about how advertising works we generally think about how advertising campaigns work. That we make an ad or a series of ads. We run them in media and hopefully something happens. People buy our products or become aware of our brand or some other observable or measurable outcome. Then we stop running our campaign and the effects stop. And then we do another one. And again that one makes people buy from us or think differently of us. And along we go doing one after the other and banking the results one at a time. Now if we think about advertising effectiveness only like that then our definition of effectiveness is always that the campaign has kind of immediately resulted in something. Sales have gone up or people have engaged with our brand or changed their behavior in some way. And if we can't clearly see any immediate results from our campaign we have to conclude that it hasn't been effective. It hasn't caused any effects. The thing is advertising is an only effective when it causes immediately observable effects. If we want to understand how advertising really works to grow businesses and make them stronger we need to understand advertising in a general broad sense and we need to understand advertising campaigns in a much narrower and more specific sense. Now the general broad sense how advertising works covers all of the advertising that a brand runs over say a year working collectively and in totality to support and grow the business to build up its brand and to maintain or increase its sales gradually consistently and over the long term. The narrow specific sense how advertising campaigns work is each individual advertising campaign and what it's specifically setting out to do which might be to communicate a particular message about a product or get people to take advantage of a promotional offer or to change the way people feel about the brand. Now the reality is that both are important for any brand to perform well it's necessary that we have an effective overall advertising strategy and plan and that we also have effective individual campaigns. So let's explore both. But first I want to define what I mean when I use the word effectiveness. There are of course lots of effects that advertising can create. It can stimulate a growth in sales or market share. It can increase understanding of the benefits of a product or improve awareness for a brand. It can change people's purchase behavior and get them buying more or more often. It can generate lots of attention get lots of likes and shares and media stories. So which of those equal effectiveness. Well there are two main views on this. The first is that advertising is about creating commercial outcomes. Whatever we're doing should ultimately ladder up to and results in a commercial outcome for a business. That is it should increase the brand's sales grow the brand's market share or increase the profitability of the business. The second view is that effectiveness is simply the meeting of objectives. Advertising can be considered effective if it's done what it was created to do. If the client's objective was to get lots of likes on social media and the ad got lots of likes then the ad was effective regardless of whether it did anything to improve sales or brand health. The debate on which of these two truly defines effectiveness is often had when judging effectiveness awards and neither is necessarily right or wrong. My view is that it's actually a combination of those things. I agree that advertising should in just about all cases be striving toward a hard commercial outcome. I think that's what we're here to do to build the brand and the business and that we should judge advertising on its success in doing that. But there are often many paths to creating those commercial outcomes. Sometimes it's about stimulating a certain kind of behavior change. Other times it's about changing the way people feel about the brand. Other times it's just about getting the brand in front of people consistently over time so that they become more and more familiar with it. Effectiveness is really about whether we were successful in achieving our brand or behavior objectives and whether as a result we saw sales or market share or profitability grow. When I talk about effectiveness on this program, when I say something's been effective, I mean that it's ultimately driven some kind of sales or market share or other hard commercial outcome for its brand and business. But on the way to delivering that commercial outcome, the advertising has usually created a range of other effects which are like stepping stones to those ultimate commercial effects. We're going to look at those stepping stones in detail when we explore how advertising campaigns work, but for now let's go back to that question of how advertising works. Not individual campaigns, but all the advertising a brand does collectively. In that bigger picture broader sense, advertising increases the overall sales and market share of a business by building up familiarity with its brand among a large group of people over a long period of time. Behavioral science tells us that humans have a familiarity bias, which basically means that our brands find it much easier to choose to buy a brand that's familiar to us rather than one that's less familiar. And academic studies from the 1960s through to our digital era have corroborated the behavioral science by showing that consumers more readily gravitate towards and choose familiar brands over less familiar ones. This isn't anything to do with product benefits or brand positionings. It's much more simple than that. It's a simple fact that people are more likely to buy from a brand they're familiar with than a brand with a slightly better product or positioning. And familiarity is more than just brand name awareness. It's a sense that the brand is a regular feature in our world. We come across brands like Coca-Cola and Apple all the time. We're not just aware of them because we saw a campaign for them or used one of their products last year. We're familiar with them because we see them around us constantly. When we talk about the world's strongest or most valuable brands, we're always talking about those brands that are most regularly in the lives of the largest groups of people. Brands like Google and Amazon and McDonald's and Nike and Coca-Cola, they're around us all of the time. We see or hear from them in some way or other just about every day. Not all of that is advertising. We use Google's products most days. We drive past a McDonald's most days. We see Coca-Cola in any grocery store we visit. So it's not just advertising that's keeping us familiar with those brands, but those brands are also among the highest spenders on advertising. They're all in the top 25 global advertisers and all spend in excess of $4 billion on advertising each year. A big part of those brands maintaining and growing that constant familiarity among large groups of people is advertising frequently and continuously, making sure as many people as possible see or hear from their brand as often as possible and as consistently as possible over time. So the way advertising works in its broad sense is simply by making a brand a constant presence in the world, showing up every week to as many people as possible and reminding them we're here. Over time, the effects of this accumulate. Familiarity is impossible to create with a big bang short term campaign, but very easy to create by consistently reminding people of the brand in less flamboyant ways, week in, week out for many months. The effect is that a growing number of people become familiar with the brand, remain familiar with the brand, and as long as they don't dislike the product, end up buying the brand because it's the familiar choice. That's how advertising works at a kind of low level to build brands. When we talk about building a brand, we're really talking about making it familiar to a larger and larger group of people. Advertising plays a key role in that by simply putting the brand in front of people as often as possible. And then there's the way that advertising campaigns work. Campaigns are there to build on that base level of brand familiarity by doing something specific. It might be to stimulate sales with a promotion. It might be to change the behavior of consumers. It might be to educate people about a product or its benefits. It might be to change the way people feel about the brand or position it in a certain way. Where the role of advertising is simply to remind people of the brand and keep it in their world. The role of advertising campaigns is much more active. They're there to deliver some kind of information or trigger some kind of behavioral or emotional response. And to do that, advertising campaigns need to achieve a number of things. And to explain those things, I'll give you a view on how advertising works from an effectiveness judges point of view, based on reading and judging thousands of effectiveness award papers and case studies over my career. One thing that I've noticed when judging effectiveness awards is that the most successful papers lay their results out in a really logical way. They cover three main kinds of results in the order in which they occurred. First, they show that the campaign was noticed and well received by consumers. Then they show that having seen the campaign, consumers were influenced in some way. They felt more positively toward the brand or they acted or changed their behavior in some relevant way. Lastly, they show that the outcome of all of that was that those consumers brought more or spent more and sales or market share or profitability improved. I'll give you an example. And I'm going to use the Grand Prix winner from the first Cannes Creative Effectiveness Lines in 2011. In case you're unfamiliar, Cannes Lines is the world's largest advertising awards festival held in Cannes in the south of France each June. The Cannes Lines company is a sister company of Walk, the company that I've made this program with. Cannes Lines is kind of like the Oscars of advertising. Up until 2011, they focused on awarding campaigns for their creativity and didn't really focus on effectiveness. But in 2011, they added a new category called the Creative Effectiveness Lines, which focuses on the effectiveness of campaigns. One campaign each year is awarded the Grand Prix, meaning it's been judged to have been the most effective of all the campaigns entered. I was lucky enough to be a judge in that inaugural year, and the campaign we chose as the Grand Prix was for Walker's Crisps in the UK, and it was a campaign called Sandwich. Here's the case study video. Most British people think a sandwich is more exciting with a packet of Walker's Crisps, but less than one in ten buy Walker's at lunch. So, to remind Britain walkers can make any sandwich more exciting, we came here to Sandwich, Kent, an organised a day this tiny village would never forget. In great music. S Cassie! What was she doing here? I can't sing in my life, ever. Yeah, that's what I hate. You said we'd go and run. We've all become the same. We dress the same ways. Only our accents change. So have a nice day. Have a nice day. It was a really great campaign and really strategically interesting. They were trying to drive sales by getting people to eat walkers crisps with their sandwiches at lunchtime. A really clear behavioral outcome that they were driving toward. And the way they showed the results was very persuasive. They took us on a journey from the campaign's initiation right through all the steps to the sales and market share result with everything in between and the order it happened. And they provided good proof of all of those outcomes, which I'm going to whiz through, not to look at them in any detail, but just to demonstrate how each step on the journey was underpinned with evidence. They began with some real life events. Those were successful with the locals. Then journalists noticed and wrote about the events. Then the content from those events went viral. Then the advertising itself stood out and was liked, leading to it being a popular and critical success. Then the sales force and retailers got involved, helping put walkers crisps near the sandwiches at point of purchase. Then consumers took out the right message. And because of that, they changed their behavior. And finally, all of that added up to sales and market share turning around and growing. Now, those first five steps on this journey are what we call campaign effects. They show that the campaign stood out, cut through, was enjoyed and was shared and got lots of media attention. Those results don't yet tell us that the campaign actually did anything, but it does show that it wasn't lost among the clutter and ignored by consumers like most advertising. The next three steps are what we call interim effects. These show that because of the campaign, some important things changed. Retailers started stocking walkers crisps beside the sandwiches at lunchtime, and consumers started choosing to buy walkers with their sandwiches. And the final step is what we call commercial effects, the ultimate improvements in sales and market share that resulted from those changes. This campaign won the Grand Prix because it was highly effective. And what allowed us to easily see and believe that was that the authors of the paper had shown very simply and logically how the campaign worked. And in fact, how that campaign worked is how the vast majority of advertising campaigns work. First, they reach people, stand out, are engaged with and remembered. Then they make people think, feel or do something new or different. And this leads to people buying the advertised brand or product and choosing it over competitors. And this, I think, is a pretty simple model for how advertising campaigns work and what we need to ensure campaigns are focused on doing if we want them to work. We'll learn more about these things as we move through the program, but essentially we need great creative work for step one, work that stands out and engages people. We need good strategy for step two. We need to have determined the change we want to create and design creative work that goes after that change. And we need good media for step three. If we've done a good job with steps one and two, then the magnitude of the commercial effects will come down to how much we've spent on media and how many of the right people we've reached at the right time. And this is also a good model for how we can measure advertising to find out how well it's worked, which we'll talk more about in the objective setting, tracking and measurement module. I'll finish this section on another definition of how advertising works by Les Burnett, who is DDB's head of effectiveness and one of the world's leading researchers on advertising effectiveness. He says that advertising increases or maintains sales and margins by slightly increasing the chance that people will choose your brand, by making the brand easy to think of and easy to buy and creating positive feelings and associations via broad reach ads that people find interesting and enjoyable and targeted activation that they find relevant and useful. Now we'll dig into what Les means in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth lines in this definition as we move through the program. But what I want to focus on is the second line, where he says advertising slightly increases the chances that people will choose your brand. This is a really important point. Despite what people might believe or expect, advertising isn't magic. I think that too often we or others expect advertising to work miracles. We have mythical ideas that we can make one cheap ad and run it, and if we don't have a queue of customers outside our door the next morning, the advertising hasn't worked. That's completely unrealistic, and it certainly isn't how advertising works. Firstly, marketing is much more than just advertising. There are those three other P's beside the promotion P that advertising sits within. When the product is good and being delivered well, when the price is right, and when the position or distribution is abundant, then advertising works brilliantly to amplify all of that. But advertising can't make up for a product that people don't want, or poor distribution, a bad reputation, the wrong pricing, inadequate service, or any of the myriad other things that govern the success of a business. Secondly, advertising is an investment. Like any investment, it compounds in value over time. Whereas if you just put your money on the stock market for a few days, then pull it out again, you're highly unlikely to see much of a return. Effectiveness isn't a moonshot campaign that makes it an overnight success of a brand. That's great when it happens, but it's not really advertising effectiveness. It's more like a lottery win. Effectiveness is doing the right things consistently to build a brand and its sales sustainably over time. And this program is about how to use advertising to build great brands and companies. The truth is you can build a not very great brand or company relatively quickly these days. But those companies don't tend to last very long or deliver very much back. It's a bit like furniture. You can spend time and money finding quality materials and using proper techniques to build a piece of furniture that you love having in your home and using and which lasts for a lifetime. Or you can quickly knock up a bit of kit set furniture that takes a few minutes and costs half the price, which works fine for a bit, but which falls apart and ends up in landfill within a couple of years. And which of those pieces of furniture really cost less? Advertising is at its most valuable when it's used to build great brands and companies. When it's not thought of merely as a quick way to drive tomorrow's sales as cheaply as possible, but as an incredibly powerful tool to be invested in and taken time with in order to grow a market leading brand and business. And that's what this program is about. I'm not going to show you how to make a quick million by gaming the TikTok algorithm. I'm going to show you how to put in place an advertising strategy that will build the kind of brand that's a genuine asset for its company and which delivers great results that just keep getting better. With those slight increases, those slight chances that Liz talks about compounding over time to build incredible brands and businesses. I want to show you an ad from the early 1960s for FINA gas stations in the US made by a famous San Francisco ad man called Howard Gossage. Howard was famous for highly subversive and creative print advertising. And in this example, he uses that humility, that realism, that consumers don't care much at all about businesses and brands to talk to them in a way that recognizes there's a slight chance that the ad will work and people will choose FINA. It's pitched as the brand's motto. And it reads, if you're driving down the road and you see a FINA station and it's on your side so you don't have to make a U-turn through traffic and there aren't six cars waiting and you need gas or something, please stop in. Often the best advertising starts with being real about the small role that brands and advertising play in busy people's lives. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, that advertising works. If you turn it off, sales decline and keep declining. Secondly, that advertising works in a different way to how advertising campaigns work. Advertising works in aggregate for a business by continually building and maintaining the familiarity of a brand by just having it out there in the world. Because humans have a familiarity bias, brands that are kept familiar are the ones that keep growing. Advertising campaigns work by building on that base level of familiarity and achieving something specific. They do this by first reaching people, standing out and getting engaged with and remembered. Then by making people think, feel or do something new or different. This leads to people buying the advertised brand or product and choosing it over competitors. We should design advertising campaigns to be able to move through these steps. And finally, advertising is not magic. It's a valuable force, but it can't work miracles. Effectiveness isn't winning the lottery on a moonshot ad campaign that creates overnight success for a brand. Effectiveness is investing wisely in good advertising that will pay large dividends over time. So that's it for this first module. Now, over the next couple of days, I want you to read over the workbook for this module, Make Notes, and if you have time, have a look at the extra content. If you have questions about the content in today's session, leave those in the comments section on this page and we'll endeavor to answer those either here on the page or in the next live session. And I look forward to seeing you for module two.
