 Hi there and welcome back to today's module on building mental availability. This module is based primarily on the work of the Ehrenberg Bass Institute who pioneered the ideas of mental availability and distinctive assets, concepts that have over the last decade or so become hugely popular in marketing. So today we're going to look at what mental availability is, why it helps brands grow and how we can use advertising to help build it. And then we'll look at what distinctive assets are, how they help make brands more effective and valuable and how we can use advertising to build and maintain them. 

So let's start with the concept of mental availability. In essence, this is a pretty simple idea, but it gets a little more complicated. So I'm going to start with the simple essence. Brands have two kinds of availability. They have physical availability, which is their product's physical presence at a point a consumer is looking to purchase from the category. Basically this is distribution, making sure your product can be easily and conveniently found and bought by your customers. In 1923, Robert Woodruff, the former long-serving president of the Coca-Cola Company said that Coke should always be within arm's reach of desire. This idea underpinned their strategy to absolutely maximize their physical availability by making Coke accessible just about everywhere. And so now, everywhere we go, whether it's a gas station, a corner store, a supermarket, a restaurant or bar, an airport or sports club or any of the thousands of places Coke vending machines live, there's always a Coke to be found. That's what high physical availability looks like. 

But there's also another kind of availability, which is known as mental availability. Mental availability is a brand's ability to easily come to mind at the point at which a purchase decision is being made. Let's say someone's thirsty and feels like a refreshing drink. For most of the world, Coke comes to mind pretty quickly as an option. It might not be the option that we choose, but Coke is so familiar to us and ever-present in our daily lives that it easily comes to mind. This mental availability isn't just about shelf space and vending machines, though. It's also about everything else that keeps us reminded of the brand, keeps the brand in our world. And that's often advertising, but not necessarily creative campaigns. For example, Coke's strategy of branding every convenience store in the world isn't just about signposting that Coke's available in that store. It's also a way of making sure that all of us feel an ongoing sense that Coke's around us and in our world. We walk, ride, or drive past those convenience stores every day, and every day our familiarity with Coke is topped back up. We don't even need to look directly at the Coke signage or read it. Just seeing the big familiar red and white smudge out of the corner of our eye is enough to give us a quick reminder that yes, Coke's still there in our world. And that's what mental availability is really about. Not just being aware of the brand, but feeling a sense of current familiarity with the brand. A sense that I've seen that brand around recently. 

I'll give you an example of the distinction between brand awareness and mental availability. We all know the Kodak brand. We're aware of it. And in case you thought Kodak was dead, it does in fact still exist and made over a billion dollars in revenue in 2020. So you're aware of Kodak. But I bet you don't feel a sense of current familiarity with the brand. I bet the last time you bought a camera, you didn't think of Kodak at all. You were most likely choosing a smartphone that happened to have a camera attached to it. Kodak doesn't feel like it's been in your world any time recently. You probably feel like you don't know much about Kodak today. You have some memories, perhaps even fond ones about Kodak from the past, but you're not really sure who they are or what they're up to today. So if they offered to sell you something, I bet you'd hesitate. You'd want to know what's happened since you last bought that disposable Kodak camera back in 1999. Are they still a reputable company? Are their products any good? Why haven't you heard anything from them in all this time? 

Current familiarity is much more powerful than simple awareness. We find it much easier to buy from brands that feel as if they're in our world today than we do from brands that we're aware of but we feel more distantly familiar with. Here's how Byron Sharp puts it. Why are some brands more popular than others? Why in the US are many more Ford sold than Renault's? Perhaps when buyers actively consider both Renault and Ford, they prefer Ford. Perhaps Ford is better. But in France, Renault outsells Ford. And Renault owners throughout the world report similar satisfaction to Ford owners. The answer is that many more car buyers remember to consider Ford than Renault. In most markets, Renault seldom gets a look in. This is not because people dislike Renault or think it lacks desirable features. It's just that outside of France, few people think of Renault. So the big marketing issue is how to get a brand thought of more often in more buying situations. In other words, how to build mental availability. So a brand that has high mental availability is a brand that comes to mind very easily and feels very familiar to us when we're in the process of buying from or using that brand's category. 

So if I say to you, who comes to mind when you think about searching for something on the internet, Google comes really easily to mind. You're also aware of Yahoo. And if you're old like me, you're also aware of Ask Jeeves and AltaVista. But you probably don't feel nearly as familiar with Yahoo as you do with Google. Google is in our world every day, all the time. Now that's pretty easy if you're a massive global internet monopoly. So let's choose a more down to earth example. If I say who comes to mind when you feel like eating a burger, the McDonald's brand pops into most people's minds pretty easily. Now if you're a relatively well paid marketing or advertising person who's a bit of a foodie and can afford something nicer than McDonald's, you might not think much about McDonald's yourself. But let me assure you, most of the world does. Like Coke, McDonald's have done a lot to maximize their physical availability. But they've also been remarkably consistent about always being in our world using their advertising and marketing. Where I live in New Zealand, most people are also aware of Burger King and Wendy's and Carl's Jr. But they're reminded of those brands only infrequently. Most of the time they don't feel as currently familiar with those brands as they do with McDonald's, which just seems to be a constant presence in our world. Whether or not we eat there much ourselves. 

What both mental and physical availability do is make a brand easy for consumers to choose and buy. If it's available in the supermarket where I do my shopping or on the way home from work in a drive-thru, then it's easy for me to buy. That's how physical availability makes brands easy to buy. Mental availability makes brands cognitively easy to buy. Mental availability reduces the amount of work our brain needs to do in order to conclude that the brand is an acceptable choice. If we feel familiar with a brand, and in a way that isn't negative, we're more likely to trust that brand. Comency really does breed content. We are much more at ease with things that we're familiar with. It's not that we never choose brands we're less familiar with, but it takes more mental effort to do so. We have to think about it, ask questions, do our research, or take a risk on the unknown. These are all more difficult to do than simply reaching for the easy, familiar thing. 

And mental effort is one of our biggest enemies as marketers. For the simple reason that consumers have way too much to think about already, anything that adds to that load has a slim chance of success. As we'll explore in the next module, we make most of our decisions using what the behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 thinking. It's very fast, effortless, and intuitive. We need to make most decisions in this way because there are simply too many decisions to make every day to spend time logically thinking through all of those decisions. If we tried to do that, it would take us weeks to get through a single day. The choice of which brand of milk to buy, which power company to use, which fast food joint to take the kids to, or which search engine to use, these choices just aren't that important to us most of the time. So our brain makes those choices in the easiest possible way. It defaults to what behavioral economists call heuristics. A heuristic is basically just a mental shortcut. A good example of a heuristic is price. If I tell you I have one carton of 12 eggs that costs $2 and another carton of 12 eggs that costs $5, your brain concludes that the $5 carton is most probably better quality, more ethically farmed, maybe organic. You don't actually know any of those things, but your experience tells you that usually things that are more expensive are better. So there's a good chance that you're right. Now if you're buying eggs for a weekend brunch and you want it to be really special, I bet you wouldn't take your chance on the $2 eggs. But I bet you also wouldn't stand there with your phone researching both egg companies to make a robust decision on the relative value of each product. You want to make a good decision, but it's not that important. So you default to what behavioral economists call the price quality heuristic. And we use heuristics like this all the time. We have to because there are too many decisions to make the long way. In the average supermarket, there are about 30,000 products available. In every aisle, there are loads of choices of different brands of similar products. Were we to walk around and really think about every decision, we'd be there for weeks. So we often default to another well-documented heuristic, the familiarity heuristic. This is the fact that people will default to choosing things that feel more familiar to them. Familiar things feel more comfortable and more trustworthy to us. It's easier to choose familiar things than it is to choose less familiar things, which is what brings us back to mental availability. That familiarity that people feel with brands with high mental availability makes it easy for those brands to be chosen and broad. So to summarize at this point, mental availability is a brand's ability to easily come to mind at the point at which a purchase decision is being made. Brands that feel currently familiar, we're aware of them having been around us and in our world recently come more easily to mind. Brands with high mental availability are easier to buy because that current familiarity makes us feel better and less doubtful about them. Building mental availability is really just about the brand being around as many people as possible as regularly as possible. This happens naturally for really big brands like Coke or Google or McDonald's because they're naturally constantly around us on and offline. But advertising or any other form of marketing that keeps our brand popping up in people's lives can also build mental availability. So that's the simple version. And now I'll take you through the more complex explanation of mental availability. Remember we talked about brands that come to mind when you feel like a burger and how for most people McDonald's comes easily to mind. That's the simple form of mental availability, which is just about which brands come to mind when you think about a certain category. So you could do the same for any category, which brands come to mind for you when you think about sneakers or insurance or sliced bread. But in any of those categories, people end up shopping them for many different reasons. Let's pick sneakers. There may be all kinds of reasons you end up thinking about or shopping for sneakers. Perhaps your last pair of sneakers wore out and you need a new pair. Perhaps you're going to a special event and need something fancy to wear. Perhaps you've taken up jogging and need running shoes. Perhaps you're a sneaker freak and want to add to your collection. Ehrenberg Bass calls these different buying situations category entry points or CEPs. In any category, there are lots of different category entry points, lots of different reasons people end up shopping the category. And we can figure them out by asking some common questions around what's brought people into the category, like when it is or where they are or who they're with or how they're feeling. The advanced version of mental availability is that any brand's mental availability will differ across these different category entry points, that they'll be easy to think of in some category entry points and not so easy to think of in others. Here's an example going back to the shoe category. If your category entry point is that you've taken up jogging and need running shoes, then the brand Essex might come to mind. But if you're looking for something fancy to wear, then you probably wouldn't think of Essex. Perhaps you'd think of Nike. Maybe if your old sneakers had worn out, you might think of Adidas or Nike. So a brand with really strong mental availability is a brand that comes to mind across lots of different category entry points. A brand like Nike with super high mental availability would come to mind easily in just about any sneaker category entry point you can think of. A brand like Essex, on the other hand, would come easily to mind and running, but not in other category entry points. So its overall mental availability would be lower. Now a lot of the time, mental availability is determined by product range. People specialize in running shoes, whereas Nike make all kinds of sports and casual shoes. But within your product range, the idea is to make your brand easy to think of in all the category entry points that are relevant to your range. When this happens, you have what Ehrenberg Bass call high mental market share. That is, you have high mental availability across many different category entry points. And they've shown that there is a correlation between this mental market share and actual market share. As we grow our mental market share, our real market share is likely to follow. Here's mobile phone brands in India. On the vertical axis is mental market share. That is, the level of the brand's mental availability across the range of key category entry points. On the horizontal axis, the brand's actual market share. As one increases, so does the other. The key outlier we see here is the iPhone, which has very high mental availability, but is much too expensive for most people in India, which explains why its actual market share is much lower. And here's insurance brands in Australia, the same really quite linear and predictable relationship between mental availability and market share. Now, I'm going to stop here in the mental availability rabbit hole. And if you're interested, I'd encourage you to read the two How Brands Grow books from Byron Sharp and Jenny Romaniak at the Ehrenberg Bass Institute, if you'd like to geek out on more detail. And let's turn now to the question of how advertising can help build mental availability. It's important to remember that mental availability isn't just about advertising. In fact, it's only a little bit about advertising. Other aspects of marketing, especially distribution and retail availability, have a big role to play. The fact that Coke is on the shelves of every single grocery and convenience store we shop every week is obviously a massive part of our remaining familiar with the brand. And other types of marketing communications like PR or sponsorships also make a big contribution to mental availability. Advertising can make a difference. But it's important to remember that mental availability is a whole of marketing job, not just a job for the ad agency. But yes, advertising helps. And one of the interesting things that Ehrenberg Bass published recently in the International Journal of Market Research is how advertising affects mental availability differently for existing buyers and non-buyers of brands. They looked at brands across a range of different product categories and measured their overall mental availability or mental market share. Then they looked at how this differed between people who'd recently seen advertising from those brands and those who hadn't. Overall, the difference was about 14%. That is, mental availability was on average 14% higher for people who'd recently been exposed to the advertising from the brand. But when they looked at how this differed between buyers and non-buyers of the brand, the results were quite different. The increases in mental availability among those who were buyers of the brand was only 10%. The advertising made a small difference. But because those buyers were already buying the brand, its mental availability was already pretty high for them. And advertising pushed it up a little bit further. But for those people who weren't buyers of the brand, the advertising made a much bigger difference and increased mental availability by 24%. Those non-buyers thought of the brand less to begin with, and the advertising made a much bigger difference in increasing mental availability. What can we learn from this? Well, let's think back to the targeting for growth module, where we learned that brands grow much more by driving penetration among new customers than they do by driving loyalty among existing customers. So what this research shows is that advertising is really useful for building mental availability among new customers, making them more likely to buy the brand, meaning that penetration increases and the brand grows. So if you're wanting to improve mental availability with advertising, it's much more effective to focus your efforts on new, lapsed, or light customers. But how does advertising create mental availability? Essentially, mental availability is built by continually reminding people of the brand and by associating the brand with important buying situations or category entry points. Remember back to the long and short module, where we saw that campaigns that ran over longer terms outperformed those that ran over shorter terms? One of the reasons this long-term campaigning works harder is that it's helping maintain mental availability. By ensuring the brand is in the consumer's world consistently over time, we ensure that ongoing level of current familiarity. On the other hand, if we just do a campaign every now and then, our mental availability doesn't accumulate, it just spikes and falls away again. So that's the first trick, being in market regularly and consistently. The other important part is ensuring our ads are actually being noticed and reminding people of our brand. As Bill Birnback said, if your advertising goes unnoticed, everything else is academic. And so the first job is to ensure our ads stand out. This is about great creative work that cuts through. Or it can be about pretty uncreative but very salient branding like Coke does with all those convenience stores. Then if we've stood out, we need to make sure people know it's us. When people see an ad but don't associate it with the brand, they're not reminded of the brand. And hence, effective brands ensure their ads are easily recognized as their ads. That's not necessarily about slapping a big logo on everything. At its best, it's about developing assets that consumers instantly recognize. So let's play a game. I'm going to show you some images and you're going to observe what brand pops into your mind. Here's the first. I'm hoping you immediately thought McDonald's. How about this one? Yep, Coke. And this? Yep, M&Ms. What about this guy? A little less famous, but it's the most interesting man in the world from the campaign by Doseki's Bear. What about this? It's MasterCard. And lastly, one that might be a little more tricky. That one's Tiffany and the color that they've owned for decades. All of those were examples of what are known as distinctive assets. Distinctive assets are symbols that the vast majority of consumers associate strongly with a brand and only with that brand. You don't have to ask what brand. It just comes automatically to mind. They're non-brand name elements that our brand triggers. They can be monograms or characters or slogans or sounds or colors or celebrities. And those are a few more there at the bottom. Nike, Target, Uncle Ben's and Coca-Cola. Distinctive assets are another thing that make our brains do less work. It's less work for us to glimpse at a shape or color than it is for us to read a word like a brand name. And as we talked about before, the less work we make consumers' brains do, the better. When we have and use great distinctive assets, everything we do becomes instantly recognizable as ours. When people only glimpse a part of our advertising, they're still reminded of us. We can have fun and be highly creative and engaging in a way that our brand and only our brand could. Brands that develop and maintain these distinctive assets are measurably more effective over the long term. Kantar's Brands E initiative looks at brands with what they call high brand imprint, which is another way of saying they have strong distinctive assets. They found that those brands are more salient. They're more likely to stand out and be recognized because their assets are so recognizable. They end up having much greater brand value because that familiarity and recognizability is understood to be highly valuable. And they grow their brand value more quickly than brands without those strong distinctive assets. And moving back around to mental availability, what distinctive assets help us do is keep our brands salient and familiar more easily because they make us much more immediately recognizable even out of the corner of a consumer's eye. And so the way that advertising can contribute to building mental availability is by establishing and consistently using these distinctive assets. Rather than the brand looking completely different every time it shows up, having a set of design or creative elements, be they colors or shapes or characters that we consistently use over a long period until they're ubiquitously and uniquely associated with our brand. And this is an important point to bear in mind. An asset is only really a distinctive asset if it's both recognized by the majority of consumers and they associate it uniquely with us and not with any other brand. This framework shows what we should be aiming for. The vertical axis is fame, how well known the asset is. The horizontal axis is uniqueness, how uniquely consumers associate the asset with your brand and no others. Assets that are very famous and recognizable and also very uniquely linked to your brand are considered strong, distinctive assets. Visual cues or assets that are very recognizable to the category but could be for any brand should be avoided. An example of this is doctors and white coats and the color blue in healthcare advertising. A doctor in a white coat and a blue color scheme tells everyone that this is an ad for some kind of medical or healthcare brand but it could be for any medical or healthcare brand. And no, consumers will not go to the trouble of looking closely at the little logo on the doctor's white coat. Assets that are unique to your brand but not yet widely known are opportunities for investment. Assets that are both unique to your brand and widely recognizable are true distinctive assets and ones that you should use as much as possible and protect or risk losing them. You know the Energizer Bunny? That distinctive asset that was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame in 2017? Well, he or she was originally the Duracell Bunny. Have a look at this ad from 1979. Duracell batteries can keep all the toys and electronic games in your home running a lot longer. In fact, tests prove that after just a few hours of continuous use, regular carbon batteries wear out. But depending on the toy, Duracell batteries can last up to six times longer. So keep your toys and electronic games running longer with Duracell. The Coppertop battery. No regular battery looks like it or lasts like it. Yep, Duracell let the trademark lapse and Energizer stole it. Energizer is now nearly twice the size of Duracell. So when you've got a strong distinctive asset, protect it. And it's important to remember that distinctiveness is in the eye of the beholder or in our case, the consumer. If we as marketers think we have a distinctive asset, but if we showed it to consumers, they wouldn't immediately associate it with our brand, unprompted, then we don't really have a distinctive asset. We can build it into a distinctive asset over time, but we shouldn't kid ourselves that it's won just yet. The other word of caution is that distinctive assets take time to build. They're not the product of one campaign or even the product of one marketing department's tenure. They take years or even decades to build up to the point where you can take your name away and still have a completely recognizable brand. McDonald's, Nike and Apple are all examples of companies that spent decades investing in their distinctive assets until they could show up without naming their brand and have pretty much everyone on Earth instantly know it was them. So it's a long journey, but it's a journey worth beginning or if someone before you began it, it's a legacy worth continuing. Let's finish on a great case that brings a lot of this together. This is a really interesting case from Heinz in the UK. In that market, Heinz is a big brand. Their meals and sources ranges have 90% household penetration. Brand awareness is pretty much 100% and they're one of Britain's most popular brands. Their problem wasn't that people didn't know about the brand or even that they weren't buying it. Their problem was that people bought cans of Heinz food, then left it sitting in their cupboards, which meant they weren't buying new Heinz products. And so overall sales were in decline. So Heinz and their agency reasoned that they had high physical availability. So high in fact that Heinz products were physically available in just about everyone's pantry at home. But they needed greater mental availability around meal times so that people would take those products out and use them. Now meal times happen every day right throughout the year and Heinz couldn't afford to run TV advertising every day all year round. So they did something really smart. They sponsored the ITV national weather forecast, which is broadcast every day of the year at lunchtime and dinnertime. This gave them short ident spots every day, which they use like this. It's a cold and wet outlook with some heavy downpours throughout the day. Heinz Big Soup sponsors ITV national weather. Visibility may be low this evening as the cold weather hits. Heinz Soups sponsors ITV national weather. And they only needed short spots because they weren't trying to communicate product information or tell a long story. They just needed to keep the brand feeling consistently familiar and use Heinz's distinctive assets, particularly that shape outline they call their keystone. This sponsorship package meant that they reached a huge amount of their audience very frequently and ended up with three and a half times the TV ratings they'd had the previous year with a similar budget. And what happened after years of declines year on year sales went up 16%, a whopping 110 million pounds in incremental sales as people used up what they had in their pantry and then bought more Heinz products. What can we learn from this? Firstly, focus on category entry points that are important. In Heinz's case, it was people wondering what to take out of the pantry for that next meal. Secondly, look for media solutions that get you close to that category entry point cost effectively and frequently. In Heinz's case, that sponsorship meant that they could be on TV at every meal time for a fraction of the cost of normal TV advertising. Thirdly, incorporate your distinctive assets. Heinz's keystone was there centrally in the creative assets. So what have we learned in this module? Brands have two kinds of availability. Physical availability, that is a product's physical presence at a point a consumer is looking to purchase from the category and mental availability, a brand's ability to easily come to mind at the point at which a purchase decision is being made. Both of these are important, but advertising can't help much with physical availability. Advertising is more useful for building mental availability. Mental availability is more than just brand awareness. It's the ability for the brand to easily come to mind in a purchase or usage situation. Brands come to mind more easily when they feel currently familiar to consumers, when they've been in people's world recently. This feeling of familiarity makes brands easier to buy because as humans, we're much more comfortable with and less doubtful about things we're very familiar with. The more advanced explanation of mental availability is that product categories always have lots of category entry points. That is different reasons that people find themselves in need of the category's products. A brand with high mental availability will be easy to think of across lots of different category entry points rather than just one or two. Advertising can help build mental availability in two ways. The first is by being in market more consistently over the long term, rather than popping up and doing a campaign every now and then. The second is by establishing and consistently using distinctive assets, those visual cues that consumers associate closely with our brand and which can be used to make our advertising more recognizably ours. These distinctive assets take a long time to build but end up contributing significantly to the effectiveness of the brand's advertising and the brand's overall value.
