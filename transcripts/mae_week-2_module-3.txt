 Well, hi there. Welcome back into today's module, Targeting for Growth. In this module, we're going to look at how our choice of target audience impacts our chances of growing our brand's sales and profit. Specifically, we're asking the question of whether we're more likely to grow by attracting new customers who bring new sales revenue, or whether we're more likely to grow by driving loyalty among existing customers, getting them to stay longer and buy more from us. We're going to look at the data from the Ehrenberg Bass Institute and then look at how their data is supported by further evidence from the IPA. 

Now, you may have heard this adage that it costs five times as much to win a new customer as it does to stop an existing customer from leaving. Nobody knows who first said this or something like it, but this idea really caught on with the marketing community and led to a huge focus on loyalty marketing over the last couple of decades. And it's seductive logic that if we just stop customers leaving and got them to spend a bit more, we drive growth without all of that hard work of trying to attract fickle new customers. Trouble is, it's totally wrong. At some point, someone proclaimed that it was cheaper and smarter to keep customers. It sounded good, people spread the idea, and it got accepted into marketing dogma as incontrovertible facts. But there's never been any actual evidence that it costs more to win a new customer than to keep an existing one. And in fact, what we're going to see today is that it's actually the other way around and that a much more cost efficient way to create growth is to target new customers and use advertising to build the penetration of a brand rather than trying to use advertising to build loyalty. One of the main reasons for this is that loyalty isn't something that's determined by marketing. We might think that customer loyalty, i.e. where the customers stay with a brand or buy more from that brand than from others, is a factor of how good that brand's loyalty marketing is. A brand that does lots of very good loyalty marketing would keep customers at a higher rate than a competing brand that doesn't do any loyalty marketing, right? What they discovered at the Ehrenberg Bass Institute is that loyalty is in fact very consistent within categories, regardless of the marketing differences of individual brands. Here's the banking category in Australia. The banks are ranked from biggest, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia or CBA with 32% market share, down to the smallest, the Bank of South Australia and Adelaide Bank with 1% market share apiece. And as you can see, their defection rates, that is the percentage of their customers who are not loyal and who leave each year, those defection rates are all within a small window of 3% to 7%. What's this telling us? Well, firstly, it's telling us that all of those banks are doing approximately as well as each other when it comes to driving loyalty. Somewhere between 93% and 97% of their customers stay with them from one year to the next, which is pretty good. But they're all about the same. 

You might have also noticed that defection rates trend higher as the brands get smaller. The biggest brand has the lowest defection rate and the smallest brand has the highest defection rate. And this is a pattern that we see repeating across other categories too. Loyalty rates are reasonably consistent across a category with the larger brands experiencing better loyalty than the smaller brands. Here's car brands in America. The biggest is Pontiac with 9% penetration. The smallest is Honda with 4% penetration. And the automotive industry defection means that when someone buys a new car, it's different to the brand of the last car they owned. About 65% of Americans switch brands when they buy a new car. And all of the car brands fall within a 14 percentage point window of between 58 and 72%. And again we see that the lowest defection rates, i.e. the greatest loyalty, happens on the biggest brands and the highest defection rates or poorest loyalty happens on the smaller brands. Here's cars in the UK. Ford at the top, Honda at the bottom. Ford with the best defection rate, Honda with one of the worst. This is a pattern that we see uniformly across categories. 

Category loyalty is fairly consistent across the category with the bigger brands keeping a larger share of their customers loyal and the smaller brands keeping a smaller share of their customers loyal. This is what the Ehrenberg Bass Institute called the Double Jeopardy Law. It means that smaller brands have two Jeopardy's or two things that make life harder and more dangerous for them. The first Jeopardy is that they're small. They have fewer customers, meaning less income, meaning fewer resources than the big brands. The second Jeopardy is that their customer base is less loyal and so they lose more of them each year to competitors. This is one of the reasons why bigger brands have it easier than smaller brands. It's unfair but it's the way it is and for a very logical reason. In all categories there's switching between brands that occurs naturally. Humans like variety, our tastes change or our circumstances change, so we switch to brands that fit with those new needs. In Australia, 5% of people naturally switch banks each year. Switching banks is a pain in the ass and so people only do it when it's absolutely necessary. So the banking category has very high loyalty. It's nothing to do with marketing and everything to do with the fact that it's just really difficult and time consuming to change banks. In the US, 65% of people naturally switch car brands when they buy a new car. It's really easy to switch from one car brand to another when you buy a new car. Plus we've usually advanced a little in life since the last purchase. We can now afford a higher status car brand so the car category has much lower loyalty than banks. Nothing to do with marketing, everything to do with the ease of switching and life stage needs. The truth is that the nature of the category is what determines loyalty, much more than the nature of a brand's marketing or advertising. I bet you're really loyal to the supermarket you shop at. I bet you go there for almost every shop and I bet especially if you have kids the amount that you've spent there has increased over the last two years. That would indicate that you're a loyal customer but I bet if you moved across town to an area where the nearest supermarket was a competing brand you'd never go back to your old supermarket. When it comes to supermarkets it's all about real estate. You're loyal to the closest supermarket and your spend increases as your life requirements and income increase. None of that has anything to do with advertising or marketing and everything to do with the nature of the category. Supermarket loyalty is driven entirely by how many people move house and that's a pretty difficult thing to change with an ad campaign. 

So that answers the question of why loyalty rates are always within a certain range within categories. But what about the larger brands always having better loyalty rates than the smaller brands? Why does that happen? Well when switching happens within categories it's a zero sum game. There's a finite number of customers out there in the category and within any period a certain number of them move around and because those switching customers are switching to and from all the brands in the category it means the smaller brands will always lose a higher percentage of their customers because they started with fewer customers in the first place. Now that probably sounded a bit complicated so let's reduce it down to a simplistic example. Let's say there's a small category that has two brands in it. One the big market leader with a thousand customers, the other the little challenger brand with 200 customers and let's say within a year 200 customers switch within that small category which is the natural switching in the category. A hundred switch from the leader to the challenger and a hundred switch from the challenger to the leader. They both lost the same overall number of customers and they both ended up with the same amount of customers that they had to begin with but the leader showed a 10% defection rate while the challenger's defection was a massive 50%. At first it looks as if people are a lot less loyal to the challenger brand than they are to the leader. In fact it's just that a given number of people were always bound to switch in the first place and this natural switching affected the large brand the least in percentage terms because they began with more customers. This is the other side of the argument that it's easy to grow off a small base. Tiny young brands can often grow 100% or more in a year whereas for a mature brand 5% growth might be considered a massive success but it's also much easier to lose from a small base. A small brand might lose 50% of its customers to switching in a year whereas it's very difficult for a large mature brand to lose half their customer base. 

So this explains why when we look at loyalty metrics big brands have an advantage. They have more customers so a smaller percentage leave in the natural switching merry-go-round of the category. Can we change this with marketing? Perhaps temporarily and perhaps across some metrics of loyalty but not in any sustainable way that defies the natural loyalty of the category. Here's Ehrenberg-Bass's data on the efficacy of loyalty programs across a range of different categories. The loyalty metric here is purchase frequency. Many loyalty programs are designed to provide incentives for frequent purchase but as we can see the purchase frequency of those who join the brand's loyalty programs barely differs at all from the purchase frequency of those that didn't. This again shows that there's a natural purchase frequency in the category and meaningfully shifting customers away from this is not at all easy to do. 

Now at this point you might be thinking of brands who you're sure have managed to build high rates of loyalty through marketing and advertising or loyalty marketing campaigns that appear to have been highly effective. And of course as with all of the principles that we'll explore on this program there are outliers, there are exceptions to the rule but sometimes those that we feel are exceptions aren't quite as exceptional when we really interrogate the data. Here's Professor Byron Sharpe the director of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute and the author of How Brands Grow talking at a TEDx event in 2010 about two often cited examples of brands that have cultivated very high loyalty Apple and Harley Davidson. But that's not what marketers believe. They believe that there can be small brands with highly loyal customer bases where people have fallen in love with a brand and they always cite these two examples which shows a wonderful lack of imagination. They always show the same too when there are hundreds of thousands of brands out there. Well let's have a look at some data on these two then. The poster children for passionate brand loyalty. It's Harley Davidson. Harley Davidson buyers buy Harley Davidson about a third of the time. They buy other bikes twice as often as they buy Harley Davidson which is a very normal statistic. In fact it's exactly the same statistic we just saw for retail fuel. What are Apple's? Repeat buying rates. So this is when you you own a computer say you buy an apple or a dell or whatever when you go to buy another one do you stay with the same brand. What proportion? There's dell there on 71% repeat rate. Very good loyalty. There's apple, HP compact and gateway and you can see there's nothing unusual. This is the double jeopardy pattern. Apple's scoring normal but maybe for its size slightly higher but then remember if you switch from an apple you have to swap all your software. You switch from a gateway to HP you don't and that's enough to explain a small loyalty advantage without any reference to passionate advocates and tribe members. Here's an analysis of Harley Davidson's owners and the segmentation came up the biggest segment in their bio base was this group. These were people who agreed most with statements like most of the time my bike is just parked. I like wearing a helmet. I don't know other people who ride motorbikes. It sounds like an average light motorbike rider not a passionate Harley fan does it. This group looks more like the passionate Harley fan or who we would think of as driving entirely. They most likely to agree with I like tattoos beer and I don't read books. They're least likely to have bought the bike new probably most likely to have stolen the bike. Notice that's a very small segment and they're only 10% and they're only three and a half percent of sales revenue because they don't spend very much money. They might be the true loyals but they're not very important. In fact if we actually develop a loyalty metric which the researchers did which they called Harley zeal people who said things like I would never hate Japanese bikes and things like that. Those people tend to be worth at least to the company and there's also hardly any of them. The fact is that people get excited when you say you have a Harley whereas they don't really care to hear that you have a Yamaha or Honda. Just like it's cool to say you use Apple products and it would be a bit weird to go around telling people you use Dell products. Dell has greater loyalty but we have a social environment where it's aspirational to show your affiliation to Apple and much dorkier to put a Dell sticker on your car. Marketing and advertising has had a lot to do with that. Apple's marketing is much cooler and has made the brand much cooler. It's made those who are loyal to Apple more likely to show their loyalty but it hasn't actually made its customer base more loyal but what it has done is co-opted loyal customers to attract new customers. It's turned loyal customers into advertising for the brand. Each one of those Apple fanatics driving around with an Apple sticker on their car window is making the brand more desirable to people who haven't yet bought an Apple product. The net effect is that new people are brought into the brand. Apple increases its penetration. That is a greater percentage of Apple's target market become Apple customers and that's how Apple has really grown through penetration through getting what seems like just about all of us to own some kind of Apple product and that's what advertising is good for when it comes to driving brand growth. Not loyalty getting existing users to stay and use more but penetration getting new or lapsed users into the brand. 

What Peter and Liz and the IPA have found is that it's become more common for advertising campaigns to have loyalty as an objective than penetration. We've become a bit obsessed with the idea that we can grow brands by increasing loyalty but the results show the opposite. The success rate of campaigns that target penetration increases is much higher than the success rate for campaigns that target loyalty increases. What does this tell us? Well it supports Ehrenberg Bass's evidence that loyalty is difficult to impact with advertising and it tells us that advertising is very good at driving penetration. And why is this important? Because brands grow much faster when they focus on building penetration than when they focus on building loyalty. It supports Ehrenberg Bass's evidence that loyalty is difficult to impact with advertising and it tells us that advertising is very good at driving penetration. And why is that important? Well because brands grow much faster when they focus on building penetration than when they focus on building loyalty. And this is because the spoils of acquisition are much greater than the spoils of loyalty. To demonstrate let's go back to cars in the UK. See Toyota there with 2% market share and 50% buyer defection. What should they focus on if they want to build their brand? Here's what Byron Sharp says. If Toyota were to reduce its defection rate to zero then it would gain 50% more sales which is one percentage point of market share. This one point of share is the maximum it can gain from improving retention but each share about half of new car buyers switch brands. So each share 50 points of market share are up for grabs. That is 50 times the sales potential that retention offers. Even in Ford's case up there at the top of the table a halving of defection would mean four points of market share growth. Whereas if they acquired at their relative market share level of 27% they'd grow 13.5 points. 

The simple reality is there are lots lots lots more potential customers out there than one brand will ever have loyal customers. In any category most buyers are either non-buyers or very light buyers of any one particular brand and the majority of sales tend to come from light buyers not from heavy buyers. Take the Cola category. The average Cola buyer purchases 12 cokes a year but average is not typical. A tiny percentage of Cola buyers buy 12 cokes a year. Most almost 70% by zero, one, two or three cokes a year. It's the same but even more pronounced for Pepsi. 75% of Cola buyers buy Pepsi between zero and three times a year and we're much more likely to be able to nudge some of that 75% into buying one more Pepsi than we are to convince an already heavy user to buy even more. But what if that heavy user base is buying so much that it is actually better to keep stimulating them to buy more? Another common adage is that 80% of sales come from 20% of buyers. It's the Pareto rule applied to marketing. So if 80% of our business sits with 20% of our customers then it would seem to make sense to really look after those customers, make sure they don't go anywhere and keep them buying from us. The trouble is again it's not true. On average 50% of sales come from the top 20% of buyers. Yes it's a little higher in some categories and a little lower in others but generally it's around 50%. So 50% of sales come from a small group of heavy buyers. The other 50% come from a large group of light buyers. Growth is much more likely to come from that large group of light buyers. The heavy buyers don't need much more encouragement to use you. They rarely see your brand in communications anyway as they're buying your product and interacting with you frequently and they're probably buying as frequently as they're ever likely to. It's the other group, the light buyers, who are more likely not to see your brand, to forget you exist or to forget to buy you and therefore much more likely to be affected by your advertising. And this shows in the advertising effectiveness data. What this chart shows is the number of very large effects achieved by campaigns with different target markets. On the left are business effects like sales, market share and profitability. On the right are all effects including brand health and campaign tracking metrics. What we can see pretty clearly is that the campaigns that target new customers or the whole market are two to three times as effective as those that target existing customers only. We can also see that profitable growth is more effectively achieved when we target the whole market over the mid-term and new customers over the long term. This gives us perfect evidence that it certainly does not cost more to acquire new customers than to keep existing ones. Companies are more profitable when they create growth by targeting and acquiring new customers. 

So I want to touch on a case study that really brings this to life. It's from India and it's for Gillette. You know the brand that's traditionally made more money by adding more and more blades to its razors and extracting more and more money out of loyal customers. Well in this case they took a really different approach. Not how do we attract men who shave or how do we get men who shave to spend more with us, but how do we get the huge group of men who shave infrequently or not at all to buy Gillette? And this is what they did. Women Power has come together to start a lobby group called Walls, also known as the Women Against Lazy Stubble. Now this organization aims at unifying women of the country against men who refuse to shave off their stubble. Walls is launched. Heavy traffic on the website ShaveIndia.com. Women started with women joining hands to form a group Women Against Lazy Stubble. Request all men to shave and I've tried to make them shave. Guys please go and shave. The shabby look will go away. Women Against Lazy Stubble and won't just take the lazy stubble. Lazy Stubble. Stubble at the moment. Oops. Women joined Walls in large numbers. Now at a surprisingly affordable price, 125 rupees, Gillette the best a man can get. I love that case. After Women Against Lazy Stubble, Gillette's penetration in India tripled. They got so many new buyers into the brand that their sales went up five times and their market share quadrupled. It's an awesome example of a focus on new lapsed and light customers contributing serious growth to a brand. 

Now all of that isn't to say that customer loyalty is completely unimportant. Keeping existing customers happy and buying is of course an important thing for a business to do, but that's usually more about the product, the service, the experience than it is about the advertising. Advertising can make people want to become a customer, but customers rarely leave because they don't like the advertising. They leave because they don't like the experience or because someone creates a better one. This is my favorite ad for a loyalty program. It's for a grocery retailer here in New Zealand called Four Square. I love how it's making fun of loyalty programs and at the same time focusing on what customers actually want, which is a good experience. And they've done it with an ad and a media that aren't just talking to existing customers. This is actually an ad that takes the piss out of loyalty to drive penetration. 

Going back to the IPA data, when we target very broadly, i.e. the whole market, we're more effective than when we target a particular consumer group or segment. And that idea is another one that goes against the marketing dogma that we should identify a very clear consumer target or profile and build the brand and advertising around that group. That we should own that segment and end up with more of them than the competition. But again, the data suggests that this isn't the reality of how it really works. In fact, despite most marketing departments fixating on their ideal consumer target, their brands generally end up having a customer base that is in fact pretty representative of the average category customer. Here's credit cards in the UK. Their gender and age profiles are all pretty much identical. Here's beer in Canada. Again, it's pretty hard to see much difference in the drinkers of different brands. And what's more, these brands all targeted young men with average incomes and yet massive amounts of their sales come from women, older people and low-income people. If targeting works in the way that we think it does, if advertising has the power to draw certain types of people to water brand, then that shouldn't have been the outcome. The uncomfortable truth is that advertising doesn't really have that power. Targeting certain types of people doesn't seem to have an awfully big effect on those particular people using the product any more than others. Take diet soft drinks. For decades, diet soft drinks have been marketed to women with billions of dollars of advertising. But even after all of that, women over index only very slightly in terms of consumption. Females drink barely more diet soft drink than males. If we were to believe that targeting and positioning work, then we would see mostly women drinking diet soft drinks and most the young men drinking Budweiser. But we don't because advertising doesn't work like that. And nor do people. 

As marketers, we want to bundle people into homogenous groups, put a name on them and believe they're all the same. That makes life much easier for us. How are we supposed to think about millions of unique individuals? Better to group them up so that we can get our heads around them and then market to them based on what we think about them as a group. But when we look at those groups up close and really study how similar the people within them are, the results are usually pretty sobering. The most important group of marketing for the past 20 years has been millennials and that baton is now being passed to Gen Z. We've thought of millennials as a group that are very similar in attitudes and beliefs and behaviours. And we've made ads for them based on those generalisations. Well, here's a really interesting piece of research from BBH Labs, which studies what they call group cohesion. That is how similar the people within a group really are to each other in terms of things like their demographics, lifestyle, attitudes, behaviours. Some groups like Financial Times Readers, The Rich and you and I, people in marketing, are in fact quite a lot like each other. Those groups have high group cohesion. Millennials, however, do not. And even less so Gen Z. These groups, they don't really exist other than in our minds as marketers. 

So what does all of this mean? Well, it means it's a bit useless to try to group people up, position our brand and messaging around them and then only target them with our media. In reality, we're very likely to end up with a customer base that's a similar makeup to the whole categories buyers. And so we're better to let the whole categories buyers know about our brand and our product, which again is proven out in stark relief in the IPA data. The IPA found that campaigns targeting the whole market were the most effective and much more cost efficient than campaigns that target particular segments. Remember excess share of voice from the last module? This chart shows that campaigns on average generate half a point of market share growth per 10 points of excess share of voice, but that those targeting the whole market as opposed to a particular segment were vastly more effective at creating market share gains around five times as effective. The outtake is really clear. To grow our brand, we want to be targeting all category buyers, not all people, just those who may at some point have need for what our category sells. And when I say all category buyers, I don't literally mean reaching 100% of them with every campaign. That would be impossibly expensive. What I mean is reaching as many people in that big segment of all category buyers as possible and doing that over time and across different campaigns. 

So what have we learned about targeting for growth? Firstly, that if we want our brand to grow, it's better to focus on building penetration, that is bringing new buyers into the brand, than to focus on loyalty, that is keeping and stimulating existing buyers. Loyalty is largely a factor of category conditions. Some users are very loyal, others switch around. And it's very difficult for advertising to meaningfully improve loyalty. Loyalty metrics are better for larger brands and poorer for smaller brands. This is the double jeopardy law. When you have fewer customers, you're more likely to churn a higher percentage of them than a large brand with more customers. Advertising that seeks to grow penetration is much more effective than advertising that seeks to improve loyalty. This is because there are generally far more non-buyers or light buyers of the brand than loyal customers. And that much larger group is also much more likely to be influenced by the brand's advertising. The data shows that campaigns that go for penetration by targeting new users or the whole market are much more effective than campaigns that target existing buyers. Targeting the whole market or all category buyers is the best way to grow a brand. Targeting specific segments and positioning brands around those segments doesn't work in the way we think it does. And most large brands' customer bases are reflective of the whole market, not the segment they've targeted. Okay, so that's it for today's module.
