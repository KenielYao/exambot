 Well, hi there and welcome back into today's module, Investing for Growth. In this module, we're going to look at the research into the relationship between advertising expenditure and business growth. We're going to answer the difficult question of how much we should be spending on advertising. And we're going to look at data from Nielsen and the IPA, which support each other's evidence into how spend translates to market share growth using a principle that's known as excess share of voice or ESOLV. So let's get into it. Perhaps the curliest age-old question in marketing is how much should we be spending on advertising? And I want to clarify here that I'm talking about the overall annual budget for all of the brands advertising rather than how we set budgets for individual campaigns. The question of budget setting has stumped marketers forever, leaving them to just guess or to have their budgets set for them by others. And that's often pretty arbitrary. We're simply told by our bosses how much marketing money we've got to spend based on what the finance department thinks we can afford or we should spend. Then some of that money is spent on advertising. Often it's slightly less arbitrary. The business has a view of the percentage of its overall revenue that it should be spending on advertising. And there have been some very good, large studies looking at what percentage of revenue should be spent on advertising. Recently, the well-known econometrician Dr. Grace Kite reviewed these studies looking for rules of thumb on how budgets should be set if the objective is to maximise return on investment. She found that the conclusion across three big studies, all up covering tens of thousands of companies, was really consistent. The company should spend between 5% and 10% of their revenue on advertising for the highest return on investment. Unfortunately, she also found that most businesses don't spend at that level and are therefore under spending and getting a poorer overall return than if they spent a bit more. So how do we make a case for being given the right amount of budget for advertising our brand? Can we calculate where that point between 5% and 10% is for us? Well, to do that properly, we need to take into account the important combination of how much we want to grow and also what our competitors are doing with their spend. And there's one way of budgeting that does just that. And that's what we're going to explore today. It's a principle called excess share of voice. The principle comes from the research that shows that if the amount we're spending on media compared to our competitors, our share of voice, is greater than our market share, we're likely to see our market share increase. And conversely, if our share of voice is lower than our market share, we're likely to see our market share decline. This principle allows us to figure out the necessary budget to increase our market share by a percentage goal that we've set. So it's a great way to determine how much we'll need to spend on advertising if we want our business to grow faster than our competitors. So first, let's break down where this principle came from and look at the data that it's based on. To do that, we're going to go right back to 1975 when an AC Nielsen vice president called James Peckham studied many years of data from brands across 26 different grocery categories. Peckham was the first to observe that a brand's share of voice tended to be about the same as its share of market. He found a very strong correlation between these two things, share of voice and share of market. Brands with 10% market share tended to have around 10% share of voice. Brands with 60% market share tended to have around 60% share of voice. Now I want to pause on this chart for a minute and really interrogate what it's saying and what it's teaching us about effectiveness. The chart's saying that share of voice approximates market share. But if a brand has a certain share of market, it'll probably have around that same percentage share of voice. That's what it's saying. But it's teaching us something more than that. What it's teaching us is that there's a kind of law or rule at play here that although advertising effectiveness can appear to be a bit random or just a product of the quality of the advertising itself, there are actually aspects of advertising that are a bit more like physics. But there are some bigger laws that govern how effective we're normally able to be. So here's an analogy. What physics tells us is that if a person is larger, they're likely to also be heavier. Not always perfectly true, a smaller but very muscly person can be heavier than a larger person with less muscle, but broadly true most of the time. It's hard to be a very small, very heavy person, and it's hard to be a very large, very light person. Not a lot like what this chart is telling us. It's hard to have a very low share of voice and have a very large share of market, and it's hard to have a very high share of voice and a very low share of market. There's a kind of gravitational force operating on marketing. If we spend very little, we're unlikely to gain a big market share, and vice versa, if we spend a great deal compared to our competitors, we're unlikely to end up with a small market share. What this doesn't mean is that the rule can't be broken. There are certainly dots on this chart that are far from that line of best fit. They must be getting something besides media spend either very right or very wrong. So we can aspire to create a bigger brand with a bigger market share on a smaller budget, but it's useful to us to know how the rule generally works. Then we know that if we can only afford a 5% share of voice, it's unreasonable to assume that it'll be easy to gain a 20% market share. Not impossible, but difficult. Because we understand the rule, we understand that we'll need to work much harder or much smarter to beat the rule. That we'll need to count on things like higher levels of creativity or other marketing levers like distribution or pricing to achieve a result that's much better than could be expected from media spend alone. This is also useful in the managing of the expectations of others. Having them understand that the budget they've given us, which may seem like an awful lot of money to them, is in fact only likely to achieve a small result when compared to the category context. Now I'm telling you all of this because we're going to explore several of these rules over the course of the program. And they're all a bit like this one. There's a general rule that most brands conform to. If we do X, then Y is likely to happen. It's always possible to beat the rule or to be effective without following the rule. It's just more difficult and statistically less likely that we'll be successful. So if we understand these rules, we have a much better appreciation of when to follow them, when they'll serve us well, and when we want to break them. A much better appreciation of what it might take in order to do so successfully. So now back to Peckham's chart. The study didn't determine whether this link between share of voice and share of market was causation or simply correlation. Had those companies with bigger market share gotten there because they'd invested more? Or were they simply investing more because they were bigger companies with more money? He thought that it was probably the former, that if we invest more than our competitors, we're likely to grow. But it took until the 1990s for him to be proven right. When the legendary marketing professor John Philip Jones published a study of about 1,000 brands from 23 countries in the Harvard Business Review. Jones found that the brands that were in market share growth were more likely to be investing in excess share of voice. Their share of voice was greater than their share of market. He called these investment brands. He also found that the brands whose market share was declining were much more likely to be investing below their market share level. He called these profit-taking brands because they were spending less on marketing and proving their short-term profits but weakening their market share. So Jones provided some early evidence that if we want to grow our market share, we need to grow our share of voice. So now let's fast forward to 2007 when Peterfield and Lesbonnet published the first of their landmark IPA studies. It was called marketing in the era of accountability. One of their main findings was that the IPA data supported the work of Peckham and Jones and indeed proved that brands that were experiencing market share growth were investing in media so that their share of voice was higher than their share of market. This chart shows that relationship. As brands share a voice increases above their share of market, their share of market increases. And vice versa, those brands that underinvest their share of voices lower than their share of market, they lose market share. In Peter and Les's words, most stable brands lie close to the equilibrium line where their share of voice is the same as their share of market. However, those that lie above it tend to be growing and those that lie below it tend to be shrinking. The relationship shown between share of voice and share of market by the IPA data is very strong and significant at the 99% confidence level. As long as we have data on our market share and our share of voice, it's pretty easy to work out whether we're investing in a way that will underpin growth or make growth harder and declines more likely. Let's say our market share is 25% and our share of voice is 18%. This means we're under spending and that we're likely to lose market share. If our market share is 25% and our share of voice is also 25%, then we're spending adequately and we're likely to maintain market share. If our market share is 25% and our share of voice is 35%, then we are investing in excess share of voice and we are likely to grow market share. The idea is that if we want to grow, we need to invest for that growth. How much do we need to invest? How much excess share of voice do we need to buy in order to see our market share increase? Field and Badaep found that an average brand would need to invest in 10 points of excess share of voice in order to gain half a percentage point in market share. If we have 10% market share, we want to grow to 10.5%, we need to be spending so that our share of voice is 20% of our category and maintain that level of spend for one year. In 2009, Nielsen corroborated this finding using their own data. They too found that on average, 10 points of excess share of voice leads to a half a point of market share growth. That might sound like a very small amount of growth for a very large amount of spend, but remember that we're talking about averages here. What we'll look at in the later modules of the program are ways that we can greatly improve the amount of market share gains we see from our investment into excess share of voice. You might also ask about the outliers. We've all worked on projects or heard about cases where growth happened without as much media spend as we're talking about here. The data backs this up. Yes, there are outliers. Be they startups with incredibly innovative new products or mature companies who use things like distribution or partnerships that give them a massive advantage over competitors. But while these outliers exist, they are outliers. That means that they don't represent what can reasonably be expected to happen. The data shows that most of the time, most companies need to invest at normal levels to maintain their share or to grow it. If we want to grow above those normal levels while investing at or below those normal levels, then yes, we can aspire to do that. But that's almost certainly going to take more than just advertising. We can't simply go to our ad agency, give them a budget that's well below what our share of voice should be, brief them to drive high growth and tell them that that's the creative challenge. That's unrealistic and it's unfair to them. Instead, we're going to need a marketing strategy that encompasses all the other elements of marketing, like our product, our distribution, our pricing and our promotional activity outside of advertising and uses those elements to make up for our lack of appropriate media spend. Or, of course, now that we have a much more scientific way of calculating what we need to spend in order to grow, we could take that information upstairs to the finance department and ask for a realistic budget, which is a great thing to do with this evidence. Use it to have a more informed conversation with those outside of marketing who influence the budgets we have to work on, because our budget is a huge determinant of our growth. Underinvestment hobbles our chances of growing, but the results from appropriate investment can be magnified with tools like creativity, emotion, use of the right media channels and other things we'll learn about in later modules. And that's what advertising effectiveness is really about. Doing things that make an appropriate level of advertising budget produce bigger results. And one of the other things that drives the amount of return we see when we invest in excess share of voice is the size of our brand. It seems unfair, but big brands have an automatic advantage. When they invest in 10 points of ESOL, market-leading brands achieve around three and a half times the market share gains of challenger brands. This was shown by both the IPA in 2007 and Nielsen in 2009. When we're starting out, entering a category and taking share is difficult and expensive. But when we're a big player in the category, we need to spend less to maintain the market share level we have. This is one of the many reasons that so many new products fail. Harvard professor Clayton Christensen has shown that in the US, there are about 30,000 new products introduced every year and about 95% of them fail. One of the main reasons for this is that companies are generally unwilling to invest in the longer term marketing of new products. They'll invest in a launch and then marketing money tends to dry up. When the reality is that new products don't just need a launch campaign, they don't grow all by themselves. They need consistent, serious investments that grow into big brands, especially when they're new and small. So now let's look at a case study. In this video, we'll see marketing professor Mark Ritson present an FE case study on the European supermarket LIDL and show how they used excess share of voice coupled with a great creative idea to significantly grow their market share. When German discount retailer LIDL entered the United Kingdom, it encountered one of the most competitive markets on the planet. Four big British supermarkets stood in its way and after 20 years of operating in the UK, LIDL had carved out a small, impressive, but still slightly disappointing 3% market share. They asked the question, why can't we grow any more than this? And the answer came down to two things. First, the British shopper assumed after many years of training that if something was low price, it had to by definition also be low quality. LIDL's low prices, which it clearly signaled, were communicating to the British consumer, you also must be low quality too. And that was born out in the consumer research which showed that the British consumer perceived LIDL's fruit and vegetables and meat and poultry significantly lower quality than its British competition, even though in reality the quality was as good if not better. And so LIDL faced a real strategic problem. You can't use your advertising dollars to tell the customer they're wrong, even though you know your products are high quality. And yet, LIDL knew that from their experience and qualitative research, when British shoppers often accidentally discovered LIDL's quality, they were first surprised and then delighted and finally became regular shoppers. LIDL asked itself a key question in 2013, how can we engineer more of those surprises so we can grow our market share? But there was a second problem, not perceptual, if anything, an even bigger challenge to overcome. LIDL was a small brand and for 30 years, thanks to the work of marketing professor John Philip Jones, we know that small brands have to work harder. In the Harvard Business Review about 30 years ago, Jones discovered an almost perfect correlation between a company's share of market, let's say 10%, and share of voice, the proportion of advertising that it contributes to the category, let's say again 10%. He discovered that when you examine the relationship between those two, they enjoy an almost straight line relationship. If you have a 5% market share, you have approximately a 5% share of voice. And also Jones observed something was going on over time with the dynamics on that equilibrium. If a brand underspent, so it had a much higher share of market and a lower share of voice, eventually and perhaps inevitably, its market share would also fall to the levels of its share of voice. But in contrast, if a brand overspent and had a higher share of voice versus share of market, in many cases, indeed in most cases, its market share would eventually increase. That difference, that positive difference between share of voice and share of market is called excess share of voice. If I have a 20% share of voice, but only a 10% share of market, I have an excess share of voice of plus 10. We often abbreviate it to ESOV, and it's one of the most important and least understood concepts in the world of marketing effectiveness. And there was something else that Jones observed from his data. If you looked at small brands, let's say one in this case with a 5% or 6% market share, that brand had to overspend, it had to have a positive ESOV in order to maintain that level of market share, perhaps an 8% or 9% share of voice. In contrast, the big brands, let's say with 20% or 22% market share, could get away with a share of voice that was perhaps 15% or 16% and still maintain their position. How come the big brands got it easier than the small brands? Well, the answer is disappointing for all of those you believe in agility and entrepreneurial thinking. The great analysis firm Data to Decisions regularly looks at what are the key drivers of advertising profitability. When you invest a dollar in advertising, what are the factors that ensure you get a better or worse return? Here's the top 10, from 10 up as you see here to 3. And there's some usual suspects. But the two biggest ones, the two factors that guarantee the best marketing effectiveness at number two is creative execution, something we'll cover in the Tide case later in the series, but also at the top with an astonishing 18-time multiplier is just simply whether a brand is already big and large and established and has a suitable share of shelf and share of mind so that every dollar it spends on advertising immediately kicks in a significant response. The big boys always win. So as little sat down to develop its strategy in 2014, it was very clear what it had to do. First, the aspiration obviously to grow and accelerate its sales and market share. The target, all British households, it wanted to increase general penetration. The position, surprise with fun, create more of that discovery of quality. And the strategy itself is divided into two very distinct objectives. The communication strategy to overcome that first perceptual barrier, dispel the myth that little's low prices come at the expense of quality. That was done with a series of brilliant executions starting with a terrific TV advertising campaign. Now then, so tell me how does our panache au chalet. It's really good. It's the same as the French one. The blueberry muffins, their whole blueberries. If I had a cafe, I'd come and buy one. Just for your trying bread. Multi-grain loaf with 75. 75, mate. Right, let's get some spending on. Everything you see here, including the chocolate cookies, are available every day in your local Lidl. Lidl's a bit of chocolate. It's wonderful. And it was matched with print ads that rather than trying to sell products on a short-term activation basis, pushed again that message of surprise and quality through a series of cleverly written print ads. And then there was social media. Lidl picked up tweets and other social media interactions that captured the surprise of customers and then replayed them through its own media and also in store blowing up tweets and literally playing them back to thousands of customers in store. In this case, a gentleman surprised at the quality of Lidl's own wine. But remember, it wasn't just about overcoming perceptions. Lidl also had that problem of ESOV. And in order to handle that, they also had a media objective, which was commit to generating significant excess share of voice. Back in the days before this campaign began, Lidl enjoyed approximately a 3% market share and approximately 5% share of voice. That's a positive ESOV of 2%. But as we know, as a smaller brand, that's probably barely enough to maintain its existing position in the market. So in 2014, it increased its share of voice to a whopping 9%. Take the 3% market share out of the 9% share of voice. You get 6% ESOV. A year later, it increased it to a whopping 19%, giving it an ESOV of 16%. A year later, again, a 16% excess share of voice, a massive increase. Finally, in 2017, it took the foot off the pedal a little bit and came down to a 10% ESOV, still very significant. And you'll also note, as they're doing this, the market share of Lidl is beginning to move. The results were spectacular. First, that perceptual gap about quality of food in terms of fruit and vegetables and meat and poultry very quickly disappeared to the point where it became a point of parity rather than a point of weakness. And Lidl managed to double their market share in the period of five years, going from 3% share to 6% in the United Kingdom, thanks mostly to this incredibly clever campaign. In fact, Lidl's own econometric research suggests that during that four or five year period, the advertising generated a whopping £2.7 billion in incremental sales. And no surprise, in 2017, it won a gold efie for this wonderful work. The key lessons we take from Lidl. Yes, Lidl had outstanding insights, strategy and tactics, but understanding ESOV and how it played a role in their growth was the essential factor in the success of this particular campaign. Goliath usually wins against David, despite what you might have read. Bigger brands have bigger scale, they get better automatic efficiencies and should any smaller brand try and increase their spend, very often they'll dig deeper into those big poppets, spend more in order to raise the bar a little bit higher and maintain their superiority. Scale advantages, better efficiencies, deeper pockets. Size really, really is important. So to summarise, if we want to grow our brand's market share, we need to invest for growth. Investing for growth means spending enough media money that our share of voice is higher than our market share. Growth doesn't come just because we feel like we're spending a lot of money compared to our usual budgets. It's not about how much we're spending or have spent in the past. It's about how much our category competitors are spending and whether or not we're being outspent by them. We also can't expect growth to happen any time we advertise. What all the ESOL data shows is that if we have 20% market share and we're spending so that we have 20% share of voice, we're likely to maintain our 20% market share, not grow or decline. What this means is that the money that we're spending on our 20% share of voice is simply maintaining our brand's position in the market. It's necessary because if we spend less, we're likely to go backwards. This needs to be maintained and maintaining your market share position requires maintenance level spending. It's only the money we spend above that maintenance level that should be considered growth money. We should only expect growth when our budget is big enough that our share of voice is higher than our share of market. This is something that's often lost on other internal stakeholders. We tend to believe that if we grew last year, we've locked in those gains. We don't need to advertise to keep those gains. That's what last year's advertising was for. This year's advertising is there to drive growth beyond last year. We judge the effectiveness of all of our advertising spend on whether we grew sales. In fact, if we grew last year, it means we need to spend more this year to ensure we simply maintain those gains and maintain that level of sales. We need to spend more again if we want to grow further. The job of most advertising is simply to maintain our sales at the current level. It's there to remind people that we still exist and to keep buying us. That might sound a bit unexciting, but it's the reality. So it's important to think about our advertising budget in that way. Most of it is there to maintain our sales by reminding people to remember us. And the remainder is there to convince new people to buy us or to convince the same people to buy new things from us. Finally, one of the things that's becoming more difficult over time is calculating our share of voice. And share of voice itself is an old metric that was mostly used for TV advertising. So nowadays, when we're investing across all sorts of different media, we tend to think of a brand's share of spend across all of the media that they invest in and their competitors invest in. But the principle is the same. As your share of spend increases beyond your market share, you can expect to grow. As media fragment more and more, and we're spending in all kinds of weird and wonderful places, it's becoming more difficult to know for sure exactly what our share of spend is. But a good media agency should be able to give you a fair indication of your share of spend unless you're in a very new or niche category. And it's better to have a good estimate than not to know at all whether you're investing enough to grow. So the first thing to do on any brand's effectiveness journey is to get that data together. What's the total advertising spend in our category? What's our share of that? What's our market share in that same category? And is our share of spend greater or less than our market share? This gives us a good starting point in terms of knowing whether our budget is enough to expect our brand to grow. And finally, we can think of excess share of voice at a campaign level or at an overall brand level. At a campaign level, yes, it's true that if we're spending much less than our competitors on this quarter's campaign, we'll struggle to see market share gains from that campaign. So it's good to have excess share of voice for each campaign, but often it's difficult to calculate and manage at such a granular level. What's more important is thinking about the whole brand for the whole year. Overall, are we spending enough on advertising? We might spend adequately on some campaigns and too little on others, and that's OK as long as overall for the year we're spending enough. So that's where I'd encourage you to put the focus. Be really firm on the annual budget, and you can be more relaxed about exactly how that's carved up across different campaigns. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, that a brand's share of market tends to be about the same as its share of voice. Brands whose share of voice is higher than their share of market have what is known as excess share of voice. These brands tend to be experiencing market share growth. Conversely, brands whose share of voice is lower than their share of market tend to be experiencing market share declines. Smaller brands have it better than smaller brands. A small brand will need to invest much more excess share of voice to grow than a big brand will. So really, the game is to become a big brand as fast as possible so you can kick back and enjoy the benefits. Not all spend drives growth. Most spend maintains our market share position. The spend on share of voice that's greater than the share of market is the spend that can be expected to drive growth. Lastly, if you don't have perfect share of spend and market share data, it's important to do what you can to find the data that's available and make a good educated guess at your share of spend and share of market so you have as good a foundation as possible to work from. So that's it for today's module. Remember to read through the workbook on today's session and if you have time, have a look at the extra content.
