 Hello and welcome back into today's module, Objective Setting, Tracking and Measurement. In this module, we're going to look at how to create clarity by correctly and robustly setting advertising objectives, demonstrate value by tracking and measuring advertising effectiveness, and nurture confidence by socializing results in powerful ways. So far, we've talked about the main principles of advertising effectiveness, the data driven discoveries of what works and why it works and under what conditions it works. But something that's critical to underpinning those principles and fundamental to effectiveness is setting clear objectives and then measuring how we did against those objectives. After all, effectiveness is when we achieve or overachieve what we set out to do. So without objectives, we don't know what we're setting out to do. And without measurement, we don't know whether we've achieved it. Advertising is a team sport. It's a group of people, lots of different people with lots of different specializations, all contributing to making something that hopefully produces a result. But if all of those people are aligned around what the goal is, then it's really difficult for them to operate as a cohesive team working toward a clear outcome. So it's amazing how much advertising still begins with no objectives or really unclear objectives. In 2018, the IPA research clients and agencies on their effectiveness culture with some alarming results. One of the key findings was that under a third of agencies received briefs from their clients with clear objectives and deliverables most of the time. This chart shows that those two boxes on the right, the red one and the purple one, are those agencies who receive briefs with clear success criteria more than 60 percent of the time. And they only add up to 32 percent of agencies. And just 20 percent of client briefs articulate how success will be measured. And over on the client side, only 14 percent of clients strongly agree that marketing success criteria have been established internally within their marketing departments. Under half agree at all. And I've got to say, this is bananas. How are we supposed to be effective if we don't begin with any agreement on what we're trying to achieve? We don't give our agencies any idea of what their objectives are. And we have no way of measuring whether or not we've been successful. And this is data from the IPA who represent major advertisers in the UK, supposedly one of the most sophisticated advertising markets in the world. So what must it be like everywhere else? So rule number one, if you want to produce effective advertising, you need to determine objectives, i.e. what you want the outcomes of the advertising to be. And you need to have a way of measuring those outcomes so that you know whether or not you've reached them. And so this is what we're going to focus on in today's modules. There are lots of really complex and expensive and challenging ways of measuring advertising using tools like econometric modeling. And while these can have a lot of value, we're not going to cover them on this program as their entire specializations of their own. What we are going to cover is what marketers and advertising agencies should know about the key advertising effectiveness metrics that they should be setting goals around and measuring. The stuff that you don't need a statistics degree to understand and which you should be able to organize and implement yourself. And where we're going to start is by going right back to the first module where we talked about how advertising campaigns work. Remember, we looked at the simple model for the effects campaigns generally create and the order that they happen in. First, effective advertising reaches people. It stands out. It's engaged with and remembered. Then it makes people think or feel or do something new or different. This leads to people buying the advertised product or brand and choosing it over competitors. Now, within each of these steps are a range of metrics that are commonly used. There are tons of research and tracking companies out there, and sometimes they give different metrics, different names, or make up their own proprietary metrics. But I'm going to stick to the basics. So let's look at the common metrics that are used for step one. We generally call these campaign metrics because they relate directly to how the campaign has been received and market. These are metrics like impressions and reach, earned impressions and earned media value, engagement like likes and clicks and shares, or campaign awareness, recall, outtake, likability. The first is pretty basic. It's the media statistics about the number of people the advertising was shown to. This is expressed as reach, i.e. the total number of people reached or impressions, i.e. the number of times the advertising was shown. This isn't really an effectiveness metric because you've paid for this reach or these impressions to happen. Your media agency may have gotten you a bit more reach or impressions than you'd normally expect for the money, pad on the back media agency. But essentially, this is giving us a bit of a baseline for the rest of the results. What I mean by that is that if we know our campaign reached 50,000 people, then it would be unrealistic to expect 100,000 new customers. Depending on the magnitude of what we're trying to achieve, we need to know that we're at least reaching enough people to have a hope of achieving that result. Measuring reach and impressions is very straightforward. Your media agency can give you that information anytime. Then there are what we know as earned impressions or earned media value. These are metrics that tell us how the advertising spread beyond its budget. Was it interesting enough that people shared it on their social feeds? Was it newsworthy enough that the news media talked about it? Not all advertising is designed to create earned impressions or earned media. But when it is, we should set objectives around that and we should measure it. Earned impressions will be tracked and calculated by your media, digital or social people, and earned media will be tracked and calculated by your PR people. Then there's campaign engagement metrics, things like likes and clicks and shares. Again, we're not always going for lots of online engagement. Advertising can be just as effective without this sort of engagement. But if we are looking for engagement like this, again, we should be setting objectives and measuring it. Again, it's your media, social or digital people who will be able to measure this for you. And lastly, there are the metrics used when we measure a campaign's impact using traditional quantitative surveys. We'd usually engage a research company to carry out these surveys, and they'd be quantifying things like what percentage of people noticed and can recall the advertising, what message they took out of the advertising and whether or not they liked the advertising. Now, these campaign metrics, they don't yet tell us anything about whether the campaign has worked, whether it's changed behaviour or built the brand or driven sales. But they do give us an indication that we've achieved that first step, which is to produce advertising that isn't overlooked by consumers. So those are the basic campaign metrics. Step two is what we call interim metrics. They're called interim metrics because they're the stepping stones in between the campaign being seen and sales being made. What needs to happen in order for a campaign to work is that it needs to affect some kind of change in people. This might be a change in how they think or feel about a brand, or it might be a change in their behaviour, where or when or how they buy the brand. So our interim metrics focus on those two areas. The first is brand health and the key metrics here are brand awareness, i.e. what percentage of category buyers know about our brand, brand consideration, i.e. what percentage of category buyers would consider our brand next time they were shopping the category, and brand preference, what percentage of category buyers would prefer to buy our brand over others in the category. We might also measure things that are more specific to our brand, associations that we want people to have with our brand, like whether people perceive us to be high quality or great value, whether they see us as innovative and exciting or as safe and trustworthy. These brand health metrics give us a pretty good idea of whether our brand is moving in the right direction over time. If we're building our awareness and consideration and preference and the brand attributes that we know align with purchase, then our sales and market share should also be growing. And if we're advertising significantly, we should see these measures lift as more people are being introduced to or reminded of us. And hopefully our ads are making them feel positively towards us and our products. We can also track these same metrics at a product level if we're doing more product focused advertising. We can track the awareness and consideration and preference of a particular product in our range, if that's what the advertising is focused on. This information has traditionally been measured with brand health tracking research provided by the larger research companies. It can be expensive. So if you're looking for a cost effective option, check out a company that I've been involved with called Tracksuit. They provide fantastic brand tracking and a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions. The other group of interim metrics are behavioral metrics. Unlike brand health, which measures what people think and feel, behavioral metrics measure whether they've done something new or different. Unlike brand health metrics, there aren't common behavioral metrics. They vary from category to category and even from campaign to campaign. One such measure is penetration. What percentage of our target have actually bought our product in a certain period? Have we nudged more people into trying the product? The space sounds like it's just a measure of sales, but it's actually not. Penetration can go up, but if on average people buy or spend less, sales actually go down. In the FMCG or consumer packaged goods category, common behavioral metrics are frequency of purchase which means how often on average the brand is bought in a given period or weight of purchase, which means how much of the product is bought on average each time it's bought. Increasing how often people buy something or how much of it they buy each time is a good step toward overall sales going up. In the telco sector, they measure things like average revenue per user, which is a bit like weight of purchase. It's a measure of how much each customer spends. And they have a big focus on churn, which is how many customers leave and switch to another provider within a certain period. Retailers measure behaviors like footfall, how many people come into the store or dwell time, which is how long someone spends in a store or in a certain area of a store. Online, we measure things like traffic to our website and dwell time and cart size. So whatever category we're working in, it's important to understand the behavioral metrics that are most important to our brand and business or most important to the strategy. Often a good strategy will be all about creating a specific kind of behavior change to drive sales or market share up. Remember in the first module, we looked at the Walker's sandwich campaign where the strategy was to get more people to eat Walker's crisps with their sandwiches at lunch. Well, they made sure that they had a way to measure that so that they could see if what they did worked. And it did. We can see in that last bar of the chart that the number of times Walker's were eaten with a sandwich at lunch stopped declining and increased. And this is a really important point. A good strategy should always focus on creating a particular change in the way people think or feel about a brand or the way that they behave in relation to that brand. The strategic planning process is essentially about figuring out what kind of change will result in a commercial success that is sales or market share or profits improving. And when we've decided what that change needs to be, it's critical that we can measure whether we've been successful in driving that change. So in Walker's case, they had ongoing surveys tracking how often people brought Walker's crisps with their lunch so they could show that more people did that after their campaign ran. For those more traditional behavioral metrics like penetration, frequency of purchase, churn and those sorts of things, there should be someone in the brand's marketing or analytics or business intelligence functions who tracks and measures these things ongoing. And you should be across that data. If there's no such person, then it's important to have some way of measuring those things. You might access retail scan data through a provider like Nielsen or you might run customer surveys yourself. Whatever you do, if you're setting out to drive a certain kind of brand or behavior change, there's no point even starting if you don't have any way to measure it. If you don't, how are you going to know if you've been effective and successful? How are you going to learn from what you've done? Perhaps your campaign was super effective and you've unlocked a key way for your business to continue driving that behavior in future. Perhaps what you did was a complete flop and everyone needs to know never to try that again. If you can't measure it, you'll never know. So part of the planning process of any campaign should be pinpointing the brand or behavior changes you're going for and how you're going to measure those changes. And those changes are, of course, in the service of creating a commercial result. And that's step three, commercial metrics. Commercial metrics are the things that the finance department care about. Have sales gone up? Has our market share increased? Have we become more profitable? Did we get back more from our advertising investment than we spent? These metrics are mostly pretty self-explanatory and any business should be all over them. And as marketers, we should have access to the sales and market share and profitability data for whatever it is we're running advertising for so that we can see how the commercial results align with our activity. If we're advertising a specific product in our range, we need to see sales for that specific product rather than just overall sales. If we're advertising in a certain region only, we need to see market share movements in that particular region rather than just overall market share. And now we're targeting volume or value increases. Most brands measure both volume sales, which is the amount of products or units sold and value sales, which is the total dollar or pound or euro amount that those unit sales add up to. Those two sound similar, but one going up or down doesn't necessarily mean the other will. If our volume sales increase by 10 percent, but we've done lots of price discounting to get there, then our total value sales may have actually gone down. And vice versa, we could put prices up, have a few customers drop off, meaning lower volume sales. But the price increase actually means value sales have grown and we're financially better off. And this is another important strategic question. Will the business be better off with more customers or better off with higher prices and slightly fewer customers? Will it be best for our business to go for volume or for value? Sometimes it's one, other times it's the other. And that's what strategic planning is all about. It's figuring out which is the best decision. And often that decision is about what will make the business more profitable. So I want to break down where profit comes from and how advertising effectiveness can affect profit. Let's say we sell a product and its recommended retail price is five dollars. But often we're on discount. And so over a year, the average price is actually four dollars fifty. We might pay two dollars of this in retailer and distributor margins. And it costs us a dollar to make the product, which we call cost of goods or COGS. Fifty cents per sale pays for our business costs like staff wages and rent. And we spend 50 cents per sale on marketing and advertising. That means that at the end of the year, we make 50 cents in profit for each unit we sell. So that's our baseline. Now let's look at how this profit can be affected by different levels of advertising effectiveness. One important effect we've mentioned a lot is pricing power. So those brands that aren't very strong and whose advertising hasn't forged much of an emotional bond with people, they don't have as much pricing power. So they need to discount more often or more heavily to maintain their sales volumes. And when marketing is less effective, it means we end up spending more on it to create the same outcome. So when our cost of discounting and our marketing costs are higher, our profit ends up being lower. And the opposite is true. Those brands that are very strong, whose advertising has forged a strong emotional bond with people, they have greater pricing power. So they need to discount less often or less heavily to maintain their sales volumes. And when marketing is more effective, it means we end up spending less on it to create the same outcome. So when our cost of discounting and our marketing costs are lower, our profit ends up being higher. And that's how advertising effectiveness impacts on profit. Now, of course, we can also improve profits by negotiating better retailer margins or reducing our costs of goods or operating costs. Advertising can't usually help in any of those areas, but it's true that very strong brands are usually in a better position to negotiate favorably in those situations. The other commercial metric that's become very popular is return on investment. This essentially measures how much money we spent and how much incremental money we got back as a result of that spend. By incremental, we mean the income from extra sales that wouldn't have happened without the advertising. This is sometimes called Romi or return on marketing investment or ROAS, return on advertising spend. They all basically mean the same thing. So let's just call it ROI. The way ROI is usually expressed is either as a percentage or a decimal number. An ROI of 100 percent or 1.0 means that we generated exactly as much new income as we spent. We broke even. We didn't make any money and nor did we lose any. We ended up in the same place financially as we started. An ROI of 150 percent or 1.5 means that we generated one and a half times as much new income as we spent, so we ended up with more money than when we started. An ROI of 80 percent or 0.8 means we lost money. We only generated 80 percent as much new income as we spent. We advertised, but we actually ended up going backwards in financial terms. ROI tells us how efficient we're being with our spend. When we're seeing a high ROI, it means we're generating lots of new income from our spend, so we're being really efficient with that spend. When we see a low or negative ROI, we're being slightly or very inefficient with our spend. So obviously, the game is to have as high an ROI as possible. But here's where ROI gets messy. Think back to the long and short module. What we learned in that module was that advertising pays back much more over the long term than it does over the short term. Remember, we talked about harvesting existing demand and creating future demand. A lot of the work advertising does is in creating that future demand, priming people who will buy us later. Now, there's no way of seeing the immediate financial return on that investment. Because they're not going to buy until later. So the advertising has worked, but it hasn't shown up yet in the sales data. It will eventually. But if we measure ROI only in the very short term way, we don't see the whole picture. Campaigns with very high short term ROI, those very effective performance marketing or sales activation campaigns, they are great at showing impressive short term ROI. But they're pretty much useless at building the brand and business in any real longer term way. And so the problem with fixating too much on ROI is that if we just optimize everything for high ROI, what we inevitably do is pour all of our spend into tactical short term initiatives. And that's just what we see in the creative commitment data. Remember Peter Fields analysis proving that low creative commitment campaigns were the least effective. What his data also showed was that those lowest creative commitment campaigns also had the highest short term return on investment. This probably seems paradoxical, but Peter explains this really well. He says that businesses and therefore marketers and their agencies have become over focused on the very short term measures of ROI. ROI is an efficiency metric, measuring the ratio of profit growth to the cost incurred and generating it. So if we want to maximize ROI, we have two choices, maximize profit growth, which is difficult or minimize investment, which is much easier. Endless pressure to maximize ROI has beaten marketers into an advertising model that many know to be unwise of low creative commitment. Spend a little on a brief spike generating activity and the short term ROI will be impressive. So what if the sales impact evaporates within days or if long term growth will be anemic at best? The ROI numbers will keep the CFO off our backs. Mediocre growth at minute cost equals magnificent ROI. The impact on creative commitment of an obsession with ROI is very clearly shown in the IPA data. The campaigns that deliver the highest ROIs by a long way are low creative commitment ones, the very ones that underperform on almost every other business measure. Remember Peter and Les's 60-40 rule that we become less effective if we spend more than 40% of our budgets on short term performance. What happens when we obsess about ROI and start to spend much more on performance marketing is that our overall long term ROI actually decreases. And then what happens is that we drop our spend and we see our ROI increase again, which makes us believe that the best way to drive strong ROI is to actually spend less. So we drop our spend, start spending beneath competitors, believing that we are the smart ones and they're spending too much. And then we win less customers. We might have got them a bit cheaper, but ultimately we've shrunk as a business in terms of our market share. We've optimized ourselves out of effectiveness. It's crazy, but it's what a lot of businesses have spent the last 10 years doing. ROI is still a useful measure, but it's not the short term ROI that matters. It's the long term ROI. If we're more efficient than our competitors over many years, then we will win. But the game isn't just how to make today's spend as efficient as it can be. It's about how to do the things and make the investments today that mean our spend will be even more efficient tomorrow or next quarter or next year. And that's brand building and the types of ad spend whose results won't show up on the balance sheet immediately, but they will in time. So the main outtake here is that short term ROI does not equal effectiveness. In fact, very high short term ROI can be an indicator that a brand is being short sighted with its investment and jeopardizing its future success. So that's an overview of the key types of metrics that we should have in place if we're really serious about knowing whether our advertising has been effective. Campaign metrics to tell us whether our campaign is cut through and being well received by our customers. Interim metrics, which tell us whether our campaign changed the way people felt about our brand or behaved in their purchasing. And commercial metrics, which tell us whether we ended up generating a sales market share or profit return and whether that return was greater than the amount we invested. And what's as important as tracking and measuring those metrics is setting objectives around them in the first place. Before we run our advertising, we should have a really good idea of which of those metrics are important to us with this campaign. And what sort of increases we want to see on those metrics. Are we looking to grow sales, volume or value? By how much? Are we looking to increase brand consideration? By how much? Do we want to see lots of engagement with our campaign? What kind of engagement and how much? And importantly, are we trying to create a quick short term sales uplift or are we setting out to build the brand and business over the mid to long term? Right at the start of the process, when the client's working on the brief for the agency, a lot of this might be pretty unclear. Perhaps we have a sales or market share goal, but we might want to use the strategy process to determine what kind of campaign and what kind of brand or behavior shift will be the most effective in reaching that goal. And that's totally OK. That's a really good use of the strategy process to determine exactly what the objectives and metrics should be. But by the time we threw the strategy in the creative process, we should all be in agreement about exactly what the objectives are and exactly how we measure them. One thing that's important with objectives is that they're intentional and they're realistic, that they've been thought about and interrogated. Why are those the objectives? Are we putting down objectives just because they arbitrarily seem like good ones or their objectives that our brand just always seems to have in briefs? Or do the objectives truly relate to what we're setting out to do? And are they realistic? Do we really know that what we're setting out to do is achievable for the budget we've got? I've been in so many client briefings where a client's been told by their business that they need to drive sales up by 10 percent and they've been given a budget of $50,000. The most cursory look back over the history of the business would show that a sales improvement that large has historically cost them 50 times as much money as they've got to spend on this campaign. So often we set objectives without thinking much about how realistic they are. And unrealistic objectives are a massive enemy of effectiveness. They ensure we're not going to be effective before we've even started. They're unfair to the agency who want to do their best for their client, but who simply aren't miracle workers. And they're really risky for the client. They'll have to go back to their business after the campaign has inevitably not reached the unrealistic objective and admit that they've failed. When we start with unrealistic objectives, no one ends up winning. So how do we know if our objectives are realistic? Well, if we're not sure, there's a couple of ways to approach this question. One is by going back to what we learned in the investing for growth module. For a brand to be growing its market share, it should be spending so that its share of voice is greater than its share of market. So if we're setting a market share growth objective, then we should assess whether or not our spend is enough to support that growth. Ask our media partner what our spend is looking like in our category and ask them what we need to spend to be above our market share level for that period. If we don't have the right amount of budget, it's best to begin managing expectations. We can't be expected to create growth with a budget that's much less than the rest of the category is spending. The other way to determine realistic objectives is to look at norms. A norm is an average of what the result normally is for a certain type of activity or spend. We might have some of these norms already established internally. We might have already done the work that tells us how much we usually need to spend on advertising to generate, say, a percentage point gain in sales. We might know what it normally costs to improve our brand awareness by a point. We might know that when we do a campaign around a certain budget, we normally see a certain number of likes and clicks on that campaign. If we don't have them already established, then we can do some work to at least get some good norm ballparks. Look back over our last few campaigns, how much we spent on each, what each was trying to achieve and what the results were across those key metrics. This won't be perfect, but it's a better way than setting objectives arbitrarily or with blind guesswork. Another place we may find norms is with our research or media partners. They might have established norms across the board using data from all the different clients they work with. They might have specific category norms for your category. If they've been working with your brand a while, they might even have norms for your brand. So it's worth asking them whether they have any norms for the metrics you're chasing and whether they can help you set realistic objectives. If all else fails, then we need to be open and honest about not knowing if the objectives are realistic or not and using our campaign as a way to begin to establish norms. What we learn from this campaign can be the first data points we collect so that we eventually do know what our norms are. It's never too late to start. And last but not least on objective setting, how many objectives should we be setting? It could seem like we're being really robust and conscientious when we make a long list of many different objectives. It feels like we're covering all the bases and creating the best chance to end up with a campaign that really ticks all the boxes. But it's actually not that simple in real life. In fact, there's an inverse relationship between the number of objectives we set and how well campaigns end up performing. Why? Because great campaign ideas come from really single-minded briefs. It's no good to have no objectives or poorly thought through objectives, but it's also no good to have a shopping list of all kinds of things that you want the campaign to do. And this is another thing about the art of strategy. It's about figuring out the one thing this campaign really needs to focus on to make a difference. Now, if we go back to the way advertising works, those three steps, steps one and three are usually pretty consistent. We pretty much always want our campaign to stand out and be enjoyed and engaged with. And we pretty much always want the end result to be a sales and market share improvement. But step two is a little different. Sometimes our path to the commercial result is through improving the way people feel about the brand. Sometimes it's about changing their behavior. Then within that, the strategy shouldn't just be blithely make them think better about the brand. It should be something specific. We need to associate the brand more closely with high quality, for example, or our awareness is really high, but our consideration is low. And so we need to do something to lift that. Is the quickest path to growth by reducing churn or by driving up weighted purchase? Which specific behavior change are we going after? The worst creative briefs have lots of different brand and behavior changes that we're going after all at once. The best ones have just one. One specific brand shift or one specific behavior shift. Not one of each, just one. That's hard, but that's effectiveness. It's not easy. And it requires making decisions and strategic sacrifices. So my advice is to try to focus in on one key campaign metric, one key interim metric and one key commercial metric. If you can get down to that, you're giving yourself an awesome chance of doing something really effective. Now, I want to show a couple of campaigns that really show the power of that singularity of focus. The first is a campaign with a really simple singular brand shift. It's for McDonald's in Canada. They knew that people didn't feel 100 percent confident in the quality of food at McDonald's. There'd always been so many rumors and urban myths about what was really in McDonald's food. And as a result, they had poorer food quality perceptions than most of their competitors. So they focused in on that. How do they lift food quality perceptions in a world full of questions and suspicions about what's really in their food? Take a look. There are stories about us. McDonald's is both famous and infamous. Over the years, we've been picked at, hoped at, discussed and dissected. With food quality perception scores down, we decided to stop talking and start listening. See, any question of McDonald's? Well, I would like to know why they don't accommodate vegetarians. I'd like to know if it's actually 100 percent pure beef. We listened to every question. Then answered them all, openly, honestly, in real time and posted live for the world to see. Hi, I'm Hope Agazi, Director of Marketing for McDonald's Canada. I'm here with a question from Isabel M. from Toronto, Ontario. She asks, what is your food look different in the advertising than what's in the store? It'll be a direct comparison of the right side of both burgers. Perfect. We're trying to dispel this myth that there's a company out there called 100 percent pure beef. And Mika, the answer is absolutely not. Beef comes in two types, in lean and fat. And instead of keeping the tough questions hidden, we made them louder. In a new video that's gone viral, McDonald's is revealing why their burgers look better in advertisements than they do in real life. Really, the message is the food is whole. The food is real. You've got to have that Big Mac. And now the top chef at McDonald's is spilling the secret on how you can make that special sauce at home. And what started as a national campaign transformed the way people feel about McDonald's around the world. In all, we answered more than 20,000 questions, earned more than 14 million video views and achieved dramatic gains on both food quality perception and brand trust scores. By opening up and letting them in, we made McDonald's a place people could be proud to love. That campaign drove those food quality viewers to the point where they were the only ones that campaign drove those food quality perceptions up. It also resulted in a 50 percent increase in monthly store visits. And the campaign won gold at the Canadian Effectiveness Awards. And here's another campaign that was just as singular about a behaviour change. State Street Global Advisors is an investment management company that recognised that the companies they invested in performed better when there was greater female representation on their boards. So they set out to convince more companies to put more women on their boards. And you probably remember how. And the problem is this. Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. Today is International Women's Day, and one Wall Street firm is marking the occasion by placing this statue, a little girl staring down the iconic charging bull. The new image was put up by State Street Global Advisors. A powerful little girl. Representing women's daily experience of having to face a ton of bull. There's certain values like diversity that have a return. The fact that the industry has acknowledged this fund is quite important. The most famous girl in all of New York City. People young and old are flocking to her. The fearless girl on Wall Street has already made a lasting impression. The hottest selfie in town still. As she's become a social media phenomenon, Fearless Girl has also become a broader symbol of female empowerment. 19,000. 25,000. 28,000. 30,000 people have already signed a petition to keep the statue here longer. The fearless girl will be allowed to remain at her post. This statue has crystallized this moment in history. My generation fought for the women of today. So that little girl is saying a lot. That campaign resulted in 152 major companies adding a female director to their board. It also made a relatively unknown B2B brand famous all over the world. And that's the power of good, clear, singular objectives. They result in work that's much more likely to achieve that objective, but also work that's powerful enough to go well beyond and generate disproportionate fame and fortune for brands. Now, I want to finish on something that's hardly talked about at all in the world of effectiveness, which is the power of socializing the results. Most of the time, the results either just rush by in a meeting where they're presented or they're written up into an effectiveness award paper that, to be honest, will barely ever be read by anyone except the ward judges. And so effectiveness tends to get hidden away. It's not really in the fabric of our day-to-day, which means a couple of things. We're not creating a culture of effectiveness. We're not constantly reminding people that what we do is in the service of really changing things. We're not building mental availability for effectiveness if we hide the results away. And secondly, we're not reminding others, especially the rest of the business, of the difference that marketing is making with the advertising they're doing. And in a world of marketing skeptics, shouldn't we be working hard to show them that what we do really does deliver value? So I'm going to show you a video from the IPAs F-Week in London where another effectiveness expert called Tom Roach talks about how one of the agencies he worked at really socialised the results and made them part of their everyday. For me, I think part of the solution comes down to creating everyday effectiveness cultures. Effectiveness all too often just means the big stuff, big names, big ideas, big moments, big awards. But that stuff means nothing if the rest of us are not translating it into small, everyday, habitual stuff. Effectiveness is a habit, a muscle, it needs exercising every day. And so I wanted to share with you a couple of really small, everyday things we did at a previous place to embed effectiveness culture there, just on a day-to-day level across the agency, not necessarily particularly heavy data stuff, nothing about tech, tech or software. All very simple, practical, analogue things that anybody can do. So the first was just a really simple report on the back of every creative brief with what you wanted the work to achieve, what you did, what you learnt from it, what you'd do again, what you wouldn't do again. Very analogue, very simple, very obvious. And it's sort of surprising to me that this isn't happening every day in all agencies everywhere because it's super simple stuff. You know, forget some of the kind of marketing buzzwords if you're not doing this stuff. This is base level stuff. And it didn't aim just to capture effectiveness, but also ineffectiveness. In fact, it wouldn't be good if we had an ineffectiveness awards scheme. It'd be quite interesting, wouldn't it? Because real learning cultures are about learning from, probably more from the times it hasn't worked than the times when we pretend it has. We'd print those out, stick them on a wall in the agency for everyone to see. They're very useful for new business, very useful, simple, easy things to refer to. We also turned the effectiveness headlines, super simple headlines, from our campaigns into really nice, simple, beautifully designed posters. Always using the campaign assets to make them look good and designed by a professional, a proper designer, not just somebody that can do PowerPoint. And we put them up around the agency. We put them in a corridor full of them. We wanted to get them literally into the fabric of the building. And we wanted everybody to feel ownership of effectiveness, not just the strategists or data people, because it's not something that can live in a silo. It's not something that can live just on spreadsheets. It has to be shared and shared through more interesting kind of storytelling, I think, than just sharing a spreadsheet. Clients or teams who didn't have one of these wanted ones, so they would get the same kind of, you know, be celebrated in the same way. And they began to ask if they could get one too. So it had a sort of a knock on effect. And I know that the last time I showed this, an event like this, the NHS marketing guys cottoned onto it. And they're doing this in their own organization, for different kinds of audiences within the marketing organization. So it has a kind of virality, you know, not just how we often put up our work in our offices or in clients' offices. It's nice. You can actually put the data headlines on there too. And it's an expression of a thing that we talked about at my old place, which is make the numbers dance. So present the numbers in a creative way. So don't ever talk about effectiveness purely in sort of data terms. Try and bring creativity into them as much as possible. And that's a kind of mock up of a corridor that we had back at the old place. So effectiveness isn't just a 4,000 word academic essay written every two years. It can be a tweet, a poster, a five bullet point email. I know and I've talked about the NHS thing. So these were equivalents for all our nine IPA cases, similar kinds of things. And we'd also turn them into little social media videos. I'm going to pretend this is a world first world's first Instagram video for an effectiveness case study. And it was a virgin media. And I think it's silent. So forgive me. So a really simple example of how effectiveness is for everyone. Share stories, not spreadsheets, keep it simple and make the numbers dance. I think that's really practical, useful stuff that we can all do to create more of a culture of effectiveness around us. So what have we learned in this module? Firstly, that setting objectives and measuring our performance against those is really important, but that we are surprisingly bad at this as an industry, which is nuts and which is a really easy thing to fix and get better at. We've learned that there are three different main groups of effectiveness metrics, campaign metrics, interim metrics and commercial metrics. We've learned a bit about many of those metrics and that if we measure them, they collectively tell us whether or not what we've done has been effective. We've learned that ROI is a double edged sword. It's useful for showing how efficient we've been with our money, but it's a short sighted objective when used in the short term and doesn't account for the very important long term effects and return on advertising spend. And we've learned that it's critical to set intentional and realistic objectives. We shouldn't have objectives just for the sake of having some. We should know why we're setting any objective we're setting, and we should be confident that our objectives are realistic when compared to how much we're spending. We can assess whether they're realistic by looking at norms, including the norm around access, share of voice, which is a pretty good place to start. We've learned that one really good objective is a lot better than a shopping list of objectives. When we're clear and focused about what we're trying to achieve, we create the conditions for much more effective creative work to happen. And lastly, we've seen how simple and impactful the socializing of effectiveness results can be and helping us create more of a culture of effectiveness around us. So that's it for this module. Remember to read through the workbook on today's session. And if you have time, have a look at the extra content. If you've got questions about the content in today's session, leave those in the comments section of this page and we'll endeavor to get to them. And I look forward to seeing you again for our final module.
