 So hi and welcome to our very last module which is all about how to take what we've learned on the program and apply it to the brands that we work on. This last module is a little different. The video is a bit shorter and I'm going to give you some homework, more on that in a moment. What we're going to do first is look at how we bring everything we've learned together into a plan that we can execute on our brands. I'm going to take you through the Advertising Effectiveness plan on a page which shows how all of the principles fit together. Then we'll explore how to really embed these principles. Hopefully over the course of the program you've already had a few ideas about how to apply some of what you've learned. And I bet you've also looked at some of the principles and realized that it's going to take a bit of work convincing others or changing the way things are done if you're going to be able to really get to best practice. And that's the thing about Advertising Effectiveness. It's a team sport. It's really hard as one person or even one team to radically change the effectiveness trajectory of a brand overnight. There are usually lots of barriers to overcome and lots of people we need to bring on the journey so we can make the changes we need to make. And so we're going to focus on how to approach that journey. I'm going to give you a series of canvases which are essentially one-page frameworks to help you move toward best practice. These canvases are for you to use either on your own or with your team to workshop and plan toward change and improvement. You now have a knowledge and understanding of Advertising Effectiveness that's much greater than most other people working with you. One thing you may have found yourself thinking is that it would be great if all those other people had all of this knowledge and understanding too. That it might be hard to get them to agree to the changes you need to make if they aren't already bought into what you've learned on the program. And so at the risk of this sounding like a sales pitch, I'd really encourage you to encourage others to take this program. If they do, you'll find it much easier to drive change with those allies around you. We can put together packages for groups and so get in touch if it's something that you're interested in. So before we look at the frameworks, let's touch on the main things we've learned in this program. These are the eight things that I believe are the real keys to using advertising to drive sustainable growth for brands and businesses. And I believe that because it's what all the data and evidence and marketing science that we've explored has proven. Firstly, make sure you're spending enough to grow. If you want to grow market share, your share of voice needs to be higher than your share of market. Focus most of your efforts on driving penetration, bringing new laps and light buyers into the brand. Do this by targeting all category buyers rather than existing buyers or particular consumer segments. Spend around 40% of your budget on short term sales activation or performance marketing to harvest existing demand. Spend the other 60% on longer term brand building to create future demand. When you want short term sales spikes, use more rational, informational, product focused and offer driven advertising targeted at those who are most likely to buy right now. For longer term brand building, use more creative, emotional, brand focused and memorable advertising targeted very broadly at all category buyers. Make the brand easy to buy by building mental availability. Do this by ensuring the brand is consistently in market rather than coming and going with campaigns and by making consistent use of the brand's distinctive assets. Choose the advertising ideas that are the most original and engaging and invest in good craft execution. These creative award winning qualities make advertising much more likely to be effective. Maximize the creative commitment of your campaigns by running them for as long as possible and spreading them out over many different media channels. Even on low budgets, campaigns with high creative commitment are much more effective. And lastly, develop a strong culture and habit of setting good objectives and measuring the results of every campaign. Socialize the results and learn from them to continue becoming more effective. And that's it in a nutshell. Eight things that will set you up for effectiveness success. But how do they all fit together? What I'm going to take you through now is what I call the advertising effectiveness plan on a page. It brings all the principles together into an annual advertising plan based on the key evidence based principles of advertising effectiveness. One that's engineered to drive the highest long term return on investment of advertising spend. And drives brand growth through increasing penetration and maximizing mental availability. It's centered around an annual calendar and two key layers of activity. One layer is focused on creating future demand with brand building communications that prime consumers who will enter the category in future. The other layer is focused on harvesting existing demand with sales activation or performance marketing activity that converts consumers who are ready to buy now. In our brand building layer, there are five key things we need to focus on. Firstly, we need to tell the brand story with emotional comms that create positive memories for the brand. We need to choose work with creative award winning qualities, original, engaging, high craft quality. We should maximize creative commitment, run consistently over long durations and across many media channels. We should target very broadly all category buyers. And we should measure over the long term that is over more than six months using brand health tracking and long term sales, market share and profit metrics. We shouldn't determine whether or not a campaign is working until we've had at least six months of data. And we should be apportioning 60% of our media budget to this layer of activity. In our sales activation layer, there are also five things we need to focus on. In these comms, we're looking to persuade consumers to buy with rational comms that give them relevant information about the product. We should focus on strong offers and calls to action. We should run for short durations and use the media channels most likely to reach those who are ready to buy now. We should target tightly those most likely to be in the market and ready to buy now. And we should measure in the short term that is under six months using short term sales, ROI and other performance metrics. And we should be apportioning 40% of our media budget to this layer of activity. There are three things we need to do across both brand building and sales activation campaigns. Firstly, we need to make sure that we're spending enough to be effective. If we want to maintain market share, we need to invest so that our annual share of category spend is equivalent to our market share of that category. If we want to grow market share, we need to invest so that our annual share of category spend is greater than our market share of that category. Secondly, we need to build our distinctive assets. We should identify or develop recognizable assets, graphic devices, monograms, characters, slogans, sounds, colors that consumers closely associate with our brand. We should use these assets as much as possible across both brand building and sales activation or performance marketing activity. Thirdly, we shouldn't try to do it all at once. We shouldn't try to do everything with one advertising execution. Offers and calls to action are no use to long term brand building. Emotion and creativity are little used to short term sales activation. We should make separate specific executions to do each job. These can be part of the same campaign, like we saw in the Expedia case example, but don't give in to the temptation to try to make every execution within the campaign do both jobs. So that's our plan on a page. Planning the annual calendar is usually a little more complicated in real life, but this is a great place to begin our planning from, to know we're starting in a place that's setting us up for success. Do everything on that plan and it's pretty hard to go far wrong. But actually doing that can be pretty hard. Planning the principles is relatively easy. Implementing them on a brand can be much more challenging, which is why we've put together the canvases I'm about to share so that you can think productively and with others about how to apply what you've learned to the brands that you work on. There's eight canvases, one for each module except for the first introductory module and this last one. On each canvas, there's a summary of best practice for the principle taught in that module. Then there's four other boxes and questions for us to ask at each. The first box is about how we currently compare to best practice. Are we already at best practice? Are we close? Are we far? Are we not sure? Do we need to do some digging to find out? If we're not at best practice, how come? Why do we think we're operating differently to best practice? The second box is about pressures and challenges. What are the pressures and challenges that make it hard for us to adopt best practice? These might be things like existing beliefs or attitudes within our organization. It might be lack of knowledge or understanding of effectiveness. It might be process or structure issues. It might be budget or resource constraints. What does or could make it difficult to achieve best practice in our business, even if as a marketing team we wanted to? What are the forces internal or external acting against us achieving best practice? The third box is how we might overcome those pressures and challenges. This is where we need to engage our problem solving skills. What would we need to do to overcome those challenges that we've just identified and create an environment in which we're free to deliver best practice? How might we influence attitudes or beliefs, spread knowledge and understanding, change structures or processes, make a case for more budget or more resource? And the last box is about key steps and activities. Based on those ideas for how we might overcome the challenges, what are the key first steps we need to take to get going? The steps we need to take to move from where we are today to a position of best practice. This will become our to-do list to get out and start applying what we've learned to become more effective. Even once we're happy with the list, we need to task individuals with those jobs and ensure they get done. So as I say, there's a canvas for each of the key principles we've learned on the program. What I'd recommend doing before the exam is going through and quickly filling in these canvases for a brand you work on currently. Just roughly and just on your own. You can do it properly with others later, but doing it roughly on your own will really help you integrate what you've learned and highlight any areas that you might want to go back and refresh yourself on later. And it's a great way to prepare for the exam. So that's what I suggest you get started on now. Use the next 15 minutes or so to crack through a couple of the canvases. Do them all if you have time. Or do them later if you're really pressed for time. But do do them. They'll really make a difference. So this is the last you're going to see of me before you take your exam and hopefully pass. I want to say a big thank you for taking the program. I've loved teaching it and I hope you've gotten everything out of it that you were hoping for. The videos and workbooks are all here to review over the next week or so before your exam. So do go back through as much as you need to. And with that, good luck with the exam. But more importantly, good luck applying what you've learned to the work you do. I hope you and the brands you work on become much more successful as a result. Take care of yourself and all the best. Bye. Bye.
